Vernon Park Church of God,20.0,"We plan to use the urban and community forestry grant to significantly enhance the ecology and aesthetics of our church campus by planting 20 trees of 7 varieties. Our efforts will be strategically focused on three main areas of our church campus: creating a tree line near our rear pond, adding fruit trees to our farm area, and planting trees at the front of our church campus near the main road.
Detailed Plans:
1. Rear Perimeter and Large Pond: Our campus, previously used for farming, currently lacks sufficient shade for our community to fully enjoy its beauty. We will plant 10 trees near our rear pond to provide a shaded area near the water, creating a serene spot for the community to relax and appreciate the natural surroundings. Tree varieties include Eastern White Pine, Red Maple, Eastern Red Bud, Bur Oak, and Kentucky Coffee.
2. Front of the Church: Four additional trees will be planted at the entrance of the church, near the main road, to create a more inviting and attractive frontage. These will also be a combination of the aforementioned tree varieties.
3. Farm Area: On Mother Carr’s Farm area, we will plant 6 apple trees (3 Granny Smith and 3 Honeycrisp) to support our upcoming honeybee operation through enhanced pollination. This will also add to the overall biodiversity and productivity ","The combination of urban forestry and community farming provides a sustainable and healthy environment for our church, community and farm that not only creates a greener space but also fosters a sense of community and environmental stewardship.   
 Benefits include:    
 * Improved Air Quality: Within the last 2 years, our community has added 2 trucking operations, decreasing the air quality around our campus. Trees act as natural air filters by absorbing pollutants and releasing oxygen, which will act to improve the air quality.
 * Aesthetic Appeal: Beautiful tree-lined streets and a shaded pond will create a serene and attractive environment, making the area more inviting for residents and visitors and encouraging more outdoor activities.
 * Cooling Effects: Shaded areas will provide much-needed relief during hot summer days, creating comfortable spaces for relaxation and activities.
 * Community Engagement: Involving local high schools and community members in tree maintenance fosters a sense of ownership and pride, while providing valuable educational opportunities.
 * Addressing Food Insecurity: The addition of fruit bearing trees to the CSA offering will improve the availability of fresh fruit and vegetables for the community. Additional Initiatives: - Educational Signage: Install informational signs near trees and the pond to educate the community about the different tree species, their benefits, and the ecosystem. - Community Events: Organize seasonal events such as tree planting days, fruit harvest festivals, and workshops on sustainable farming practices to encourage community participation. - Composting: Start a community composting program to recycle organic waste from the farm and church, enriching the soil and reducing waste.",1975 East Joe Orr Rd, ,Lynwood,IL,60411,1975 East Joe Orr Rd, ,Lynwood,IL,60411,"Our project will support urban and community forestry workforce development over the 3-year period. We will provide training in tree planting and maintenance for our Project/Green Teams, Farm Team, youth program and interested volunteers and community members. Workshops and training will cover tree planting and maintenance fundamentals, disease identification, pest management from local area experts. . 

We will continue to offer this training annually as refresher training for returning workforce and any newly interested volunteers and community members. We anticipate that training requirements for the first year will be 10-15 people and approximately 10 people for the 2nd and 3rd year.

We will offer these classes for local area high schools students in Agriculture education program to participate. 

We will utilize inhouse and  local resources such as Openlands and the Morton Arboretum to learn more about tree selection, planting, care, health and pest control. ","We will utilize the services of a local landscaper to assist in design, procurement, and placement of our trees. This will allow time for us to provide initial training for our workforce and community engagement plan.  Once our trees are planted, our workforce team will be responsible for all maintenance activities according to the below schedule: 
Year 1:
• Watering: Trees will be watered weekly during the first growing season to establish strong roots.
• Mulching: A 3-inch layer of mulch will be applied around each tree to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature.
• Education: 2 Training sessions will be conducted for youth and volunteers on proper watering and mulching techniques.
• Responsibility: Our Project Manager will oversee the initial maintenance efforts with the help of trained volunteers.
Year 2:
• Watering: Trees will be watered bi-weekly, adjusting based on weather conditions to ensure adequate moisture levels.
• Mulching: Mulch will be replenished as needed to maintain a 3-inch layer, ensuring continued protection and nourishment.
• Pruning: Light pruning will be conducted to remove any dead or damaged branches, promoting healthy growth.
• Education: Continued education sessions will be provided to reinforce maintenance practices among farm team, youth and volunteers.
• Responsibility: Project Manager & Farm Manager
Year 3:
• Watering: Monthly watering will be sufficient unless conditions are exceptionally dry, ensuring trees remain healthy.
• Mulching: Mulch will be replenished as needed to maintain optimal soil conditions.
• Pruning: Annual pruning will be performed to shape the trees and remove any problematic branches, supporting long-term health.
• Monitoring: Regular health assessments will be conducted to identify any issues early and address them promptly.
• Responsibility: Project Manager & Farm Manager.","['Eastern White Pine', 'apple', 'Pine', 'Red Maple', 'Oak', 'Bur Oak', 'Coffee', 'Maple']","{'Eastern White Pine': 2, 'Red Maple': 2, 'Eastern Red Bud': 2, 'Bur Oak': 2, 'Kentucky Coffee': 2, 'Granny Smith': 3, 'Honeycrisp': 3}","['Improve Air Quality', 'Enhance Aesthetic Appeal', 'Provide Cooling Effects', 'Promote Community Engagement', 'Address Food Insecurity', 'Install Educational Signage', 'Organize Community Events', 'Start Composting Program']"
St. Moses the Black Parish,20.0,"Our urban and community forestry project is based on the principle of investment. We want to invest in the health our our neighbors, invest in the care of God's creation, and invest in beautifying the southside of Chicago. This project is about more than planting trees! It is a project that aims to invest in people by building community, raising awareness, and helping people enjoy the gift of beauty that surrounds them.

We intend to plant 20 trees on our campuses, with 6-7 on each of our three campuses. We intend to plant a mixture of pear trees, northern red oaks, and pagoda dogwoods. ","Our church members, visitors, and neighbors will all benefit from tis project. As we enhance the beauty of our campuses we hope to create an environment that is welcoming, calming, and awe inspiring. We believe God to be the author of creation, and as we share in the work of caring for our common home we seek to lead people to a deeper encounter with the divine. We are blessed to be in a part of the city that is filled with trees, parks, and even some open spaces. However, a good number of the trees surrounding our campuses have been damaged or removed in recent years. We see this project as an opportunity to contribute to increasing the trees in our communities.

Our project will directly support environmental justice in our community because we will use this project as an opportunity to promote greater advocacy and education around environmental justice. 

Our project may support workforce development in our community because we will likely need to hire someone to help care for the newly planted trees.

We hope that those who enjoy the beauty of our campuses will find peace while they are visiting us. Unfortunately our parish campuses are in neighborhoods where too many experience the effects of gun violence. We hope to create spaces where people can enjoy God's creation and find a sense of inner peace. Not only will we be planting trees as part of this project, but we will also enhance our gardens and outdoor sitting areas.",331 E 71st Street, ,Chicago,IL,60619,331 E 71st Street, ,Chicago,IL,60619, ,"Our parish contracts with a landscape company to help us care for our grounds. They will provide additional support for the ongoing care of the newly planted trees. We will work with them to ensure we plant the trees in a proper way, and they will ensure we have the necessary tools to do that. Volunteers will assemble to do the work.

We have found mulching trees to be very beneficial and we continually add mulch as needed throughout the first three years after planting. We have staff that does new mulching throughout the spring and
summer season at all of our campuses. Normally make a dike approximately 12-15"" away from the base of the tree with dirt during planting and then follow up with adding 3-4"" of mulch on top of and around the tree but keeping the mulch slightly away from the trunk to prevent excess moisture and decay around base of the tree.

Our staff will inspect and review all trees on a regular basis to assign maintenance tasks or to see what maintenance might be done.  For the first 2 years of growing new trees are watered twice a week utilizing tree watering bags if no rain is received. After year 2, we water as needed for the next several years depending on precipitation and weather patterns. We have numerous seasonal staff that assist in watering all trees on a regular basis. The Parish will utilizes a water truck and also a water trailer to make sure trees are receiving proper watering. 


We have staked many of our trees in the past using a 3 sided approach and using a piece of rubber to protect the tree so the guidelines don't damage the bark. Usually this is needed due to our high winds. 
After 2 years these are removed. We make sure the support lines and stakes are still taunt and not damaging the trees is part of our normal inspection process and make any adjustments as needed
with staff.

Checking on the health of the trees is very critical to sustainability and is done often. Inspection will consist of checking on the guidelines, moisture content, diseases, mulch, any broken limbs, etc. We
will then assign staff to correct any issues based on the inspection of these trees. In the past we haven't experienced many of these issues, however, should any issues arise, St. Moses the Black Parish will
make sure to address the appropriately. All trees are mulched around and have a protective sleeve around the stem of the tree for the first 2-3 years

Our practice is to only trim out broken branches and dead branches until the second or third year. Once the trees are established and growing at a steady rate we would then focus on trimming out branches that are weak or growing in a way that may lead to later damage or breakage. No heavy pruning occurs until the trees have grown enough to possibly have the lower limbs become a factor in mowing, or clearance of vehicles and pedestrians.

Our maintenance staff and creation ministry members will be responsible for maintaining the health of the trees long term.",['pear'],"{'northern_red_oak': 2, 'pagoda_dogwood': 2, 'pear_tree': 14}","['Enhance the beauty and welcoming atmosphere of campuses', 'Create an environment that is calming and awe-inspiring', 'Promote a deeper encounter with the divine', 'Increase number of trees in communities', 'Advocate for and educate about environmental justice', 'Support workforce development through hiring for tree care', 'Provide peace and inner calm for visitors amidst gun violence', 'Enhance gardens and outdoor sitting areas']"
Wood St. Collective,35.0,"Wood St. Collective owns and operates a half-acre urban farm in West Englewood that will house the proposed Urban Food Tree Orchard. We will plant 35 fruit and nut trees in three, 100’ rows that, when mature, will yield hundreds of pounds of produce annually. Our tree plan includes: apple (6), pear (6), cherry (6), peach (6), plum (6), paw paw (3), and pecan (2). We will integrate the Food Tree Orchard into our food access programs, which annually distribute 10,000 lbs of fresh vegetables every year to Chicagoans with food insecurity. Our organization collaborates with about 20 nonprofits, churches, schools, and youth centers to provide hunger relief.  This project requires funds for site preparation, tree planting and post-planting care that will ensure trees funded by this grant are in good health and have robust yields.

Our urban agriculture site is accessible to the public year-round, so this Orchard will also serve as a community green space. West Englewood is, like many Southwest Side of Chicago neighborhoods, a pollution hotspot. In West Englewood, census block groups are between 2% and 12% tree cover. This translates to an elevated heat disparity of +5 to +11 degrees F*. Even worse, Chicago has historically placed its industrial zones in neighborhoods comprised of predominantly low-income Black or Latinx residents, leading to higher concentrations of air pollution and disproportionate rates of chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma. Improved tree cover is sorely needed to reduce the health harms caused by environmental racism, and Wood St. Collective’s Urban Food Tree Orchard is designed to reach a vulnerable community in need of environmental restoration and health equity.

In addition to food access and increasing access to green spaces, our proposed project will also support the community through workforce development. We seek funds to create opportunities for forestry education. That’s because trees are critical infrastructure to improve air quality and reduce CO2 in the atmosphere. We want to inspire and empower Chicagoans to improve their communities’ canopy. We will coordinate 10 annual forestry workshops that will reach about 150 Chicago Public School students and 300 adults every year (our project goal is 1,500 total), offer 9 total stipends for low-income residents to complete the Openlands Tree Keepers forestry training, and provide jobs to people with barriers to employment like justice-system involved individuals.","Our organization is 100% Black- and Latinx-led, operating in low-income Chicago communities where we live, love and serve. Our proposed project improves climate resilience while simultaneously investing in youth education, youth employment, and workforce development in a neighborhood experiencing significant economic blight. 

The American Forest Tree Equity Score shows the South and West Sides of Chicago as high priority areas to increase the canopy cover. That’s because Northwestern University reports that there is 32% higher concentrations of air pollutants in Chicago’s South and West Side neighborhoods (Anatasia Montgomery, Sept. 2023). To mitigate what are called “urban heat islands” and “air pollution hotspots,” Wood St. Collective, an Englewood-based nonprofit, is launching a new forestry program, the Urban Food Tree Orchard, that reflects how dire we feel the environmental situation is in South and West Side communities. Why does one street flood during an April thunderstorm and not the other? Because the street next to the park doesn’t flood. Fields of grass and trees create a sink effect and absorb the water, protecting neighborhood infrastructure. An oak grove, an orchard, or any density of trees in a hyper-local area, act as a carbon sink, annually absorbing up to 20 tons of CO2. 

No matter whether a community faces high flooding risk, high atmospheric particulate matter, or an extreme heat disparity, trees are critical infrastructure to improve resilience to ecosystem stressors and create equity. It’s important to us that the Orchard is publicly accessible because we want the increased tree cover to be felt by residents. Urban forestry projects in low-income neighborhoods, historically, often fail to engage residents because organizations without a meaningful connection to the neighborhood will not see the prevailing social and economic issues that, for most residents, take precedence. That’s why it’s so important to Wood St. Collective to co-create with community members, facilitate workshops, and offer stipends for forestry certifications — to inspire environmental leadership. Physically situated within one block of a CPS high school, an elementary school, and a Chicago Public Library, the proposed Flagship Orchard for Forestry Education aims to reach 500 students by 2027.",3312 S. Halsted St. , ,Chicago,IL,60608,3312 S. Halsted St. , ,Chicago,IL,60608,"In our experience, people without strong ties to nature can quickly connect to plant life through reciprocal relations, such as plant care leading to the harvest of fruit or vegetables. This phenomenon, where people connect better to plant life through food, is how Wood St. Collective plans to use the Urban Fruit/Nut Tree Orchard to nurture environmental education and leadership through our proposed 10 annual workshops for South Side residents and families. Youth-focused workshops will focus on tree biology and tree ID while adult-focused workshops will cover advanced topics like tree soils, pruning, planting, mulching, working with volunteers, advocacy, and pests and diseases. As a result of strong relationships with CPS elementaries and high schools, we expect that the Forestry Workshops will annually reach about 150 students and youth and 300 adults; in total, about 1,500 people during the funding period. Our aims are to inspire environmental leadership, share knowledge that will promote action and involvement among workshop participants, and as a free program, create accessibility for low-income Chicagoans interested in forestry and green jobs.

We are an environmental organization based on the South Side of Chicago—all we do is address barriers to eco-friendly practices. In our experience, the greatest barrier is often financial. People don’t have time to volunteer when their families are struggling. Even teens often must work to support the household. Which is why our proposed project seeks funds to cover stipends for people to complete the Openlands TreeKeepers Certification. We are seeking grant funds to cover an individually awarded $450 stipend to interested West Englewood residents to complete the 8-day Openlands TreeKeepers Certification course that covers, through expert instruction and hands-on immersion, natural science topics and best tree care practices. Awarding stipends and covering the $150 course registration fee for the Openlands course would allow Wood St. Collective to increase access to education, promote environmental leadership, and lay pathways to green jobs for residents seeking to gain employment in urban forestry. Over the three year project period, Wood St. Collective seeks to provide 21 stipends that will create a qualified pool of residents to do paid forestry work for our organization and others. ","Wood St. Collective staff has forestry certifications and can assess if a tree has proper mulching, needs pruning or staking, or has deteriorating health. Wood St. Collective will, on a case-by-case basis, contact a certified arborist for support.

Mulching is extremely important for tree health because it maintains soil temperature and moisture. It will be mandated in the Tree Maintenance Plan to re-mulch trees covered by this grant every Spring to ensure proper depth and protect tree roots during warm temperature months. Wood St. Collective expects a healthy circumference of mulch around each tree, relative to tree size. Staking can be accomplished with thin, hardy strips dug into the ground, which trees will be tied to with a biodegradable rope. 

Our urban agriculture site has on-site water, and we have budgeted for an irrigation system that can distribute water evenly to each tree and also quantify the amount of water distributed. In terms of amount of water and frequency, it will be outlined in the management plan that trees will be watered on a weekly basis in the growing season.

Our primary source of protection for the planted trees will consist of tree tubes, which have proven to not only protect young saplings, but to also promote growth through creating a small scale greenhouse effect.

Ericka Guzman, Program Manager, has supported our Block Beauty program that, since 2020, has built 60 green spaces and planted 250 trees in Chicago’s South Side. In the foreseeable future, she will manage the health of Urban Food Tree Orchard. She has the Openlands TreeKeeper Certification and was formerly a farm steward at Gary Comer Youth Center.

Wood St. Collective plans to train and hire two forestry interns, who will complete the Openlands TreeKeeper Certification course and be on-boarded by Wood St. Collective so that they can support our organization’s proposed forestry workshops. They’ll be expected to learn about topics like tree soils, pruning, planting, mulching, working with volunteers, advocacy, and pests and diseases.

Groundwork Indy,50.0,"The “Indy Planted” project is a community-centered initiative focused on establishing an accessible urban orchard for the residents of Indianapolis. Through this project, we will plant 50 Honey Crisp apple trees on a four-acre plot managed by Groundwork Indy. These trees, each approximately 4 to 5 feet tall, will be spaced 18 feet apart to promote optimal growth and create a sustainable, productive orchard for community members to harvest fresh fruit.

As a local nonprofit dedicated to environmental and youth development, Groundwork Indy will leverage its resources and expertise to independently implement and maintain this project. Our rotating team of 25 part-time Green Team members (ages 14-18) and 10 full-time GroundCorp members (ages 16-24) will actively contribute to the orchard’s planting, care, and long-term sustainability. The initial labor, including planting, mulching, and setting up protective tree guards, will be completed by the GroundCorp team. Meanwhile, the Green Team will gain valuable experience by learning about tree care, environmental impact, and the importance of local food systems through ongoing educational activities connected to the orchard.

The $30,000 grant funding will support project components essential for successful establishment and maintenance. This includes purchasing 50 Honey Crisp apple trees, mulch for each planting site, tree guards for protection, Tree Diapers for efficient water use, and labor for long-term upkeep.

Beyond producing fresh fruit for the community, the orchard will provide cooling benefits, improve air quality, and support local biodiversity. Groundwork Indy’s environmental commitment ensures this project will meet ecological needs while promoting food security and green workforce development in Indianapolis.","The primary goal of the “Indy Planted” project is to create a sustainable community orchard that benefits Indianapolis residents through increased access to fresh produce, environmental improvements, and hands-on workforce training. By establishing an orchard of 50 Honey Crisp apple trees on a four-acre plot, we aim to provide an ongoing source of fresh, healthy food for the community. The trees will be freely accessible, encouraging residents to harvest fruit as needed, promoting food security and nutrition among neighborhood families.

Community and Environmental Impact: Our project addresses environmental justice by providing a green space that helps offset urban heat, improves air quality, and supports local biodiversity. The orchard will mitigate temperature extremes and provide shade, enhancing the urban environment and contributing to cleaner air. Through these benefits, the project will foster a healthier, more sustainable community and help address inequities in access to fresh food and green spaces. The orchard also offers a vital habitat for pollinators and other species, enriching local ecosystems.

Workforce Development: A core objective of “Indy Planted” is to provide valuable workforce development opportunities for youth through our Green Team and GroundCorp programs. The Green Team’s younger members, aged 14-18, will engage in hands-on learning about tree planting, care, and environmental stewardship, developing skills and knowledge that promote lifelong environmental awareness and leadership. The GroundCorp team, with members aged 16-24, will gain direct job experience in landscape management, tree maintenance, and urban forestry. This project will equip these young participants with the skills needed for careers in green infrastructure, environmental services, and sustainable agriculture.

Additional Community Benefits: We envision “Indy Planted” as a gathering space where residents can connect with nature, learn about sustainable food systems, and engage in healthy outdoor activities. By involving local youth in the project, we are also fostering community pride and ownership, as they become stewards of an important resource. In the long term, we hope to see improved community health and well-being, strengthened social ties, and increased community engagement with environmental issues.
In sum, “Indy Planted” offers environmental, social, and economic benefits that align with Groundwork Indy’s mission of empowering youth and improving urban communities through sustainability and active engagement.",975 Burdsal Parkway, ,Indianapolis,IN,46208,975 Burdsal Parkway, ,Indianapolis,IN,46208,"The “Indy Planted” project aligns closely with Groundwork Indy’s mission of empowering youth through environmental stewardship and hands-on job training. This community orchard project will serve as a dynamic, real-world workforce development opportunity for participants in our Green Team and GroundCorp programs.

Green Team Development:
For Green Team members, ages 14-18, the orchard provides a unique learning experience focused on environmental awareness, sustainable agriculture, and community engagement. Through active involvement in the project, Green Team youth will participate in practical lessons on tree care, urban agriculture, and sustainable food systems, developing skills that contribute to their environmental literacy and leadership. These activities will help Green Team members gain critical skills in teamwork, responsibility, and problem-solving, qualities that will benefit them in future academic and professional settings.

GroundCorp Job Training:
For GroundCorp members, ages 16-24, the project offers valuable hands-on job experience in urban landscaping, tree care, and green space management. As the primary labor force for orchard establishment and maintenance, GroundCorp participants will gain practical skills in tree planting, mulching, watering techniques, pest management, and seasonal pruning. This experience directly translates to job preparedness in green infrastructure, urban agriculture, and environmental services, fields that are increasingly in demand in today’s economy. GroundCorp members will also receive structured life-skills and job-preparedness training, which includes guidance on resume-building, interview preparation, and workplace professionalism, enhancing their readiness for permanent employment.

Long-Term Skill Building and Career Pathways:
The skills acquired by both Green Team and GroundCorp participants through “Indy Planted” are transferable and foundational for careers in fields such as horticulture, landscape design, sustainable agriculture, and urban forestry. The hands-on experience they gain will equip them with practical knowledge and a competitive edge for entry-level positions in these industries. We also connect GroundCorp members with job placement resources, helping them transition into full-time roles within environmental and landscaping sectors after completing the program.

Community Engagement and Environmental Stewardship:
By fostering a sense of ownership and responsibility for the orchard, the project encourages youth to see themselves as vital contributors to their community’s environmental health and sustainability. This experience builds their sense of agency, pride, and dedication to environmental justice, motivating them to continue supporting local green initiatives.

Through “Indy Planted,” Groundwork Indy is not only contributing to urban greening but is also investing in the next generation of environmental leaders and professionals, strengthening workforce development in Indianapolis and beyond.","Our planting and maintenance plan for the “Indy Planted” project is designed to ensure the successful establishment and long-term health of 50 Honey Crisp apple trees, creating a resilient and sustainable orchard that the community can enjoy for years to come.

Year 1: Planting and Initial Setup During the initial phase, the GroundCorp team will prepare the four-acre planting site by plotting tree locations with 18 feet of space between each tree. This distance will allow adequate sunlight exposure, root growth, and air circulation. Each tree, standing approximately 4 to 5 feet tall, will be placed in a pre-dug hole, backfilled with nutrient-rich soil, and topped with a three-inch layer of mulch to retain moisture and reduce weed growth. Tree guards will be installed around each tree to protect them from physical damage.

To support water conservation, we will install Tree Diapers around each tree. These water-conserving devices will provide consistent moisture by releasing stored water during dry periods, reducing manual watering needs. During the growing season, each tree will receive approximately 10 gallons of water weekly, which the GroundCorp team will monitor to ensure adequate hydration and tree health.

Year 2-3: Maintenance and Growth Monitoring During the second and third years, the GroundCorp team will conduct regular maintenance activities, including checking for signs of pests, diseases, and other health concerns. Mulch will be reapplied annually to maintain soil moisture, and Tree Diapers will be checked and adjusted as necessary. Trees will also be pruned during the dormant season to encourage healthy growth and structure.

Both the Green Team and GroundCorp team members will receive training on tree care techniques, including organic pest control and disease prevention, as part of their ongoing development. This training ensures our teams have the skills needed to address issues promptly and maintain tree health.

Year 4 and Beyond: Long-Term Sustainability In the fourth year, as the orchard matures, the focus will shift to sustaining tree health and productivity. Regular pruning, organic pest control, and disease monitoring will continue, along with community harvest events where residents can pick apples. The GroundCorp team will oversee these tasks, ensuring that the orchard remains a vibrant, productive space for the community. The Green Team will continue their educational involvement, deepening their understanding of urban agriculture and the importance of green spaces.

This structured plan, grounded in best practices from the U.S. Forest Service’s Tree Owner’s Manual, positions the “Indy Planted” orchard for long-term success, providing a lasting source of fresh food, shade, and environmental benefits for Indianapolis.",['apple'],{'Honeycrisp apple': 50},"['Create a sustainable community orchard', 'Increase access to fresh produce for Indianapolis residents', 'Environmental improvements (offset urban heat, improve air quality, support local biodiversity)', 'Provide hands-on workforce training for youth through Green Team and GroundCorp programs', 'Foster a healthier, more sustainable community', 'Enrich local ecosystems by providing habitat for pollinators and other species', 'Serve as a gathering space for residents', 'Foster community pride and ownership', 'Improve community health and well-being', 'Strengthen social ties and increase community engagement with environmental issues']"
"Masjid Al-Qur'an Foundation, Inc.",50.0,"The community forestry project will have at its core tall, hardwoods including Northern Red Oak, Swamp Oak, and Chiniquapin Oak. These will fit a rough 'oak savannah theme of the project. This is ideal for allowing sunlight to hit not only the high canopy of leaves once the trees are matured, but also filter in at middle and low heights and even the forest floor. Bald Cypress, Hackberry, Tulip Tree, Apple Tree, and Pear Tree will also be planted for various reasons including their benefit as a food resource for wildlife and humans. The total amount of trees planted will have several factors to consider including the age/maturity of the trees at the time of purchase. We would like to plant less trees that are more mature as oppose to more trees but less mature. This will allow the forest to take shape and garner the needed immediate care from the community more than saplings. However we do plan to plant saplings as well. In total, we plan to plant over 50 trees.  ","The people who live closest to the physical project will benefit the most, along with the animals and wildlife that have access to the area. This is because the project is designed with 'green equity' in mind. The next to benefit the most are those participants, students, and volunteers that help plant and maintain the trees in their initial stages. The experience itself is designed to be educational and skill-building with the expectation that participants will go on to other sites and be an asset to other projects based on what they've learned with us. This project is meant to be a 'personal investment' for all those who participate with the expectation that people, especially from our congregation will return again and again over the decades to check on the trees and reminisce. 

The farm education program that already exists at the masjid has a central aim of building job skills that transition into Trades such as carpentry, electrical, plumbing, equipment operating, etc. Several things such as beforehand safety talks, a focus on production, management of time, and group communication are stressed. The actual physical strength and 'trade secrets' are also improved. The project helps serve as an outdoor space to do all of this. 

The 'green space' we hope to create should serve as an emotional and psychological retreat for members of our community. This can benefit residents of the adjacent apartments who already walk laps in the parking lot. We want to encourage them to use our nature trail as well. Sometimes students in the Sunday school have problems that are connected to more complex situations at home or with other students and require counseling. We want the green space and nature trail to serve as a retreat for them and perhaps parents or counselors to interact and talk with them in a natural setting. The goal is to make the space accessible to the community for many reasons such as these. ",11723 W BROWN DEER RD, ,MILWAUKEE,WI,53224-1446,11723 W BROWN DEER RD, ,MILWAUKEE,WI,53224-1446, ,"The planting strategy is twofold. We have to plan several Big Events (40+ trees each event) over the upcoming few years because these are the events that everyone loves and remembers. These events are mentioned in our Friday worship services and in our newsletters and often the event turns into a food event as well and many people come to observe. However, this is not the most ideal way to plant trees in our experience. Ideally we would like to plant 4 or 5 trees at a time with just a handful of participants or students. This allows us to ensure everything is being done perfectly. Students and participants gain more knowledge this way and become far greater assets to us for future plantings and maintenance. 

It is likely that we will implement a combination of both these tree planting methods. We will have large events as well as ongoing tree planting workshops integrated with out sunday school and summer camp. This will ensure that the project gets the proper recognition in our community and many people get involved and at the same time we can build our work force, education, and skill set. All the trees must be planted properly so if we notice any trees not planted correctly we will have to replant them. Acurately marking the trees with physical markers is essential especially in the first stages of their growth. We also want to have a chart available so that all trees can be identified on a map of the property. Trees must be planted in a way so that watering is practical. We have a limited amount of water hose.

Shelbyville's Forest Park is a large park where people come to have picnics, family reunions, walk their dogs, play baseball, softball, soccer, junior football, and disc golf. We also have a Family Aquatic Center, a park lagoon stocked with fish for anglers of all ages, a Forest Bark dog park, a General Dacey walking and bicycle trail, a historic Chautauqua Auditorium, and a beautiful Sunken Garden. The park is host to thousands of locals and visitors who come to Shelbyville to visit beautiful Lake Shelbyville, and for those who participate in annual events like the Scarecrow Daze street festival, the Touchstone Energy Balloon Festival, 4th of July celebrations, the Annual Festival of Lights and Festival of Trees events, and several annual downtown shopping happenings. Having additional trees in the park would provide beautiful landscaping, create a safer area for visitors and locals, boost the economic value of the park, remove air pollution from the environment, and provide much-needed shade in the heat of summer.

Glenwood Cemetery is a beautiful cemetery with trees that create shade over grave sites and the cemetery paths and roads. The cemetery has always been known for the beauty found there year-round. The loss of trees has left some areas within the cemetery without shade or protection from the elements. Replacing the trees that have been lost will provide beautiful landscaping, create a safer area for visitors, remove air pollution from the environment, provide much-needed shade in the heat of summer, and allow less snow accumulation to certain areas within the cemetery.",1501 W.

Eloe Landscapes, Garden and Home will work with J.U.L.I.E.  to make sure no utilities are buried in the selected areas of planting. Using his experience and expertise, Jonathan and the parks managers will select trees from the recommended tree list provided by Faith In Place.  Jonathan will then order the selected trees. The trees will be planted during the spring planting season to optimize the best chance of survival.  Once planted, they will be fertilized, staked and mulched to help them grow strong and straight, and to prevent moisture loss.  Every week thereafter (for at least 3 years), each tree will be watered with at least three gallons of water.  Cemetery and park workers will observe the trees for distress and disease, make sure the trees cause no safety concerns for visitors, and prune the trees if needed.

Currently, we continue to have issues with Stormwater runoff. Several negative effects, include: polluting waterways with chemicals like pesticides and fertilizers, harming aquatic life, causing erosion of stream banks, contributing to flooding, and impacting drinking water quality by contaminating surface water sources like rivers and reservoirs; which are less than two miles away. This essentially disrupts our ecosystems and is a constant threat to human health due to the pollutants it carries.
I. Health Benefits
The trees contribute many environmental benefits. that improve health outcomes. Trees contribute to better air quality improvement by absorbing the carbon dioxide and then releasing oxygen into the air. They also improve air quality by filtering the pollutants from the air increasing respiratory health issues for residents. Via stormwater management tree canopies reduce runoff by intercepting rainwater, allowing for groundwater recharge. Thereby playing a crucial role in minimizing polluted runoff entering the sewer systems of the Milwaukee River & Lake Michigan.

II. Economic Benefits 
Temperature regulation is also affected by trees as they cool the environment, reducing the urban heat effect and lowering energy costs for cooling buildings. A well landscaped green area also has been shown to enhance the visual appeal of our neighborhoods, leading to higher property values. It serves to attract more business investment in the area, bringing resources in rather than taking them out. Green neighborhoods have proven to be far more attractive to businesses, promoting economic growth within these urban communities. By investing in the communities and attracting new opportunities areas for employment and job training in new green jobs are created and training opportunities and information is dispensed to the community residents who then become a part of cutting edge technology and diverse opportunities. They have agency, commitment and purpose in their own community

III. Social and Community Benefits = Connection to Nature
Trees create a living landscape that fosters a sense of community and connection to nature, promoting mental well-being. Green spaces maximize recreational opportunities providing venues for outdoor activities, fostering community interaction and a healthier lifestyle.

IV. Environmental Stewardship
These projects empower community members to take responsibility for their local environment, promoting sustainable practices like events that encourage the use of rain barrels for water harvesting and conservation.

V. Addressing Environmental Racism and Injustice
Equitable tree distribution ensures tree planting efforts which prioritize underserved areas that may have limited access to green spaces limiting community engagement. By creating these spaces and involving community stakeholders in decision-making processes we foster a sense of ownership and responsibility. 

VI. Environmental Education
Space is created to provide educational resources and workshops that address the impacts of environmental injustice and promote advocacy for equitable environmental policies and green infrastructure. City officials work alongside community leaders to promote policies that support zoning for green spaces and sustainable urban development rather than ignoring them and creating blighted and unsafe areas.

VII. Implementation Strategies & Collaborative Partnerships
Collaboration with local organizations, schools, and environmental groups work together to maximize resources and outreach. Workshops become the means to educate on tree care, sustainable landscaping practices, and the importance of biodiversity in their communities. Monitoring and evaluation methods for students, residents and community stakeholders become inclusive and collaborative. New protocols of integration establish metrics to assess the impact of their project on environmental quality, property values, and community engagement.",1821 N. 16th Street, ,Milwaukee,WI,53205,1821 N. 16th Street, ,Milwaukee,WI,53205, ,"Tree Maintenance Plan (3-Year)
Year 1: Establishing Foundations
1. Watering
• Frequency: Water newly planted trees once a week during dry periods. Adjust based on rainfall.
• Method: Use deep watering techniques to encourage root development. Apply around the drip line ensuring the water penetrates the soil.
• Check: Monitor soil moisture levels weekly.
2. Mulching
• Type: Use organic mulch (e.g., wood chips, bark).
• Application: Apply a 2-4 inch layer of mulch around the base, extending to the drip line. Keep mulch 2-3 inches away from the trunk to prevent rot.
• Refresh: Add more mulch as it decomposes, checking every 6 months.
3. Education
• Workshop: Hold an initial training session for those responsible for maintenance, focusing on the importance of watering and mulching.
• Materials: Provide pamphlets and guides detailing proper techniques.
Year 2: Monitoring and Adjusting
1. Watering
• Adjustment: Increase watering frequency during extreme heat or drought conditions, reducing if precipitation levels rise. As a general rule during the growing season be sure to water 1x per week with 10 gallons of water especially those with leaves once they come on and until they drop.
• Assessment: Conduct a semi-annual assessment of tree health and root establishment.
2. Mulching
• Maintenance: Replenish mulch as needed, ensuring the layer remains between 2-4 inches.
• Weed Control: Regularly remove weeds from the mulch area to reduce competition for nutrients.
3. Education
• Follow-Up Session: Conduct a mid-year refresher course on proper tree care techniques.
• Feedback: Encourage participants to share their experiences and challenges, adapting the program accordingly.
Year 3: Sustaining Health
1. Watering: Utilize the 10 gallon water method per week during the growing seasons. Prune as desired for spruce trees and necessary.
• Evaluation: Evaluate the watering schedule based on growth patterns and climatic conditions. Trees typically require less frequent watering as they mature.
• Techniques: Introduce rainwater harvesting or drip irrigation systems if feasible to optimize water usage.
2. Mulching
• Long-Term Plan: Develop a long-term mulching strategy to enhance soil quality and reduce weeds. Transition to using recycled mulch materials if possible.
• Soil Testing: Conduct soil tests to determine nutrient levels and adjust mulch and fertilizer applications accordingly.
3. Education
• Advanced Training: Offer specialized training on tree diseases, pest management, and pruning techniques.
• Community Involvement: Encourage community engagement by organizing a tree care day, promoting hands-on experience under expert guidance.

Echo Valley Hope,20.0,"All trees have been chosen from the list provided in the application.
The land we have chosen is in a valley. It is flat and easy to get around to plant and care for trees. It is easily accessible for people to walk and enjoy the area. The land was deforested long ago, so we are very happy to have the opportunity to restore forest and soil, to cope with water run-off that can cause flooding and to remind people of the preciousness of trees.
We are blessed with artesian springs and creeks; the water for the trees will be pumped into tanks and easily driven to each tree location. Students, who will be enlisted to participate, will learn about conservation of water, mitigation of flooding, as well as all of the USDA tips on tree care. They will also learn about respect and proper care of tools and of one another. 
Our tree canopy and fruit tree sanctuary will be available to all community members, particularly those disadvantaged by location. 
Our shade canopy will include:- 3 Eastern Redbud, 3 red oak, 2 catalpa , one white pine, 2 burr oak,  
Our fruit stand will include: 6 apples, 3 plums, (the fruits from these trees will be available to the at - large community members)
We understand, and have allotted for the necessary distance between trees.

Our water will come from a near-by creek or artesian spring located on the property. We will use a pump to bring it into a portable tank, located on a trailer and driven by our tractor.
We will have a shelter for tools. A portable outhouse is available for guests and helpers. We will serve lunch on the days of the planting activities to foster community.","We believe the entire community can benefit. We envision an intergenerational and diverse population participating in this project. We live in a rural community that has been hard hit by environmental changes; drought (for the past few years) and flooding in 2018 and 2019 that caused significant damage to many here. Debates over how to proceed (damns, relocating businesses, and the community center) have divided the community. The logging industry has been robust and has disrupted much of the wildlife habitat, and often leaving behind dead and drying branches after taking the trunks of the trees. Concerns over fires from severe drought and increasing hot temperatures are very real, but mostly ignored. Having more people, particularly youth, aware of forestry practices, the benefits of trees and the possible issues arising from forest negligence can help this area.
There are many farm workers and Amish who play significant roles in this community and we would like to include as many as we can for their skills in developing this oasis of hope; we also want to learn from them.
As a place for intergenerational gathering we plan to provide opportunities for all to learn from one another and particularly to learn from the land.
This project will also restore some wild life habitat to a specific area that had been clear cut long ago. It will demonstrate how restoring trees to a barren landscape will provide benefit to all of us.
In that regard we believe that teaching our youth the value of preservation of natural landscapes and cultivating edible spaces is not only a necessity, but can be a joyous experience. We hope to cultivate relations among diverse people, allowing people to meet and greet and help one another.
We are unique here and for that reason many have come to visit with us, from Franciscan nuns to Tibetans walking for freedom and many more. We love sharing the land, the beauty and the reality that we are one people on one precious planet. People walk away feeling hopeful. That has always been and will remain our vision.
Many of us are LGBTQ+. At this time, as people who are seen as ""different"" are being poorly treated. LGBTQ+ youth are being harassed and the suicide hotlines are receiving over 200% more calls. For them we must remain visible. We are members of this community and have been for decades. We welcome all people and will continue to.
This area was also settled by people of color in the early and mid 19th century. They were mixed Black and Indigenous people and built famed round barns. You can read about them here on the Town of Forest website. https://townofforest.com/our-history-and-diversity/ 
Some of the BIPOC ancestors still live around here. Each year they celebrate their roots - yet there are people living in the area who post confederate flags. We believe bigotries are based in ignorance and fear. Our tree canopy will be a safe space for all, giving people a chance to meet and learn about each other.
And maybe, just maybe, more people will feel the interconnectedness with the earth and one another. That is our hope and our effort.

In the past, we had a community garden on this property for marginalized people without land of their own.

To ensure that our trees survive long term, we will implement a comprehensive maintenance plan following the guidance of the US Forest Service's Tree Owner Manual.  

Our Plan
Year 1
Planting:   We will make sure our trees are planted at least 3 feet from concrete and 15 feet between the trees.  We will also check for power lines above to make sure trees won't interfere.
                   We will call underground utility service before we dig.  We will be careful moving the trees.  We will minimize pruning at this juncture. We will find the main root system and remove excess soil.   We 
                    will remove problem roots.   We will determine how deep and wide to dig.  We will dig the hole only as deep as the root system.  We will put the tree in the hole and remove root ball packaging
                   We will fill the hole with the same soil.  We will water the tree with 5 gallons of water and put mulch 2 inch layer of mulch around it.

Watering:  Trees will be watered weekly with 10 gallons of water.
Mulching -  A 2-inch layer of mulch will be applied around each tree to retain moisture
Responsibility:  Members of our green team will oversee work with the help of trained volunteers.

Year 2:
Watering:  Trees will be watered bi-weekly to ensure adequate moisture levels
Mulching - Mulch will be replenished as needed to maintain a 2-inch layer to ensure protection of the trees
Pruning - Light pruning will be conducted to remove dead branches
Education:  Education sessions will be provided to re-enforce maintenance practice among youth and adult workers
Responsibility - The green team will continue to supervise this work.

Year 3
Watering:   Monthly watering will continue.  If additional water is needed due to drought, it will be applied.
Mulching:  Mulch will be added as needed
Pruning:  Annual pruning will be done to ensure the trees are growing and healthy.
Responsibility -  Regular assessments will be done by the green team to address any problems.  The youth workers and adult workers will be responsible for maintenance.

Maintenance and Sustainability: Following the planting phase, the project will include a sustainability plan that features regular monitoring of tree health, watering schedules, and maintenance support from local volunteers. Educational materials and resources will be provided to empower community members to take part in ongoing care efforts.

5. Monitoring and Impact Assessment: 
To measure the success of the project, we will implement a monitoring system designed to assess tree survival rates, community engagement, and ecological benefits, such as improved air quality and increased shade.

Through this Urban and Community Forestry Project, we aim not only to increase the quantity of green spaces in our city but also to deepen community connections, foster environmental stewardship, and create lasting benefits for both residents and the local ecosystem.","Our project aims to enhance urban tree canopies while simultaneously fostering workforce development in our community. By focusing on these dual objectives, we aspire to create a greener, healthier, and more equitable environment that benefits residents, local businesses, and the ecosystem. Our vision is rooted in environmental justice, workforce readiness, and community engagement.

The primary beneficiaries of our project will be the local residents of all ages and backgrounds. The expansion of tree canopies will lead to increased vegetation filters air pollutants, reducing respiratory illnesses and improving overall community health. Access to shaded areas can also encourage outdoor activities, contributing to physical fitness and mental well-being. 

Our Tree Canopy project will also enhanced the Quality of Life by creating aesthetic beauty, reduce urban heat, and create inviting spaces for recreation and relaxation, thereby improving the residents’ quality of life.

The project will directly affect individuals seeking employment and workforce training opportunities. Through tree planting, maintenance, and landscaping, the project will create job opportunities for local residents. We plan to hire community members, including youth participants, to engage in hands-on learning experiences. By connecting participants with local employers in the landscaping and environmental fields, we will facilitate networking that can lead to internships, job placements, and mentorship. By connecting participants with local employers in the landscaping and environmental fields, we will facilitate networking that can lead to internships, job placements, and mentorship.

We will also implement training programs focused on horticulture, landscaping, and urban forestry. Participants will gain valuable skills that can lead to further employment in green industries, such as landscaping companies, parks departments, and environmental organizations.

Our project will also help local businesses benefit from the project in multiple ways such as increasing foot traffic, benefitting local shops, cafes, and markets.

Our project is designed to integrate principles of environmental justice, ensuring equitable access to the benefits of green spaces for all community members. Key initiatives include:

Engagement of Underserved Communities:
We will prioritize neighborhoods with limited access to green spaces, focusing outreach efforts on low-income areas and communities of color that have historically borne the brunt of environmental degradation.

Community-Led Planning:
By involving residents in the planning and decision-making process, we will empower marginalized voices and ensure that their needs and preferences shape the project’s direction.

Equitable Distribution of Resources:
We aim to ensure that tree planting and maintenance efforts are equitably distributed across all neighborhoods, addressing disparities in green space availability.

Education and Advocacy:
Our project will incorporate educational components focused on environmental justice, helping the community understand the importance of equitable access to green spaces and the role of urban forestry in climate resilience.

Our project directly aligns with workforce development goals, offering myriad opportunities for skill-building and economic uplift meant. We will establish training programs that focus on skills required in tree care and maintenance, including planting techniques, pest management, and sustainable landscaping practices.

Participants will have the opportunity to enroll in structured internships with local environmental organizations, providing them with practical experience and connections in the green job sector. We will also partner with local educational institutions and organizations, we will offer certification programs, allowing participants to gain recognized credentials that improve their employment prospects.

Beyond the immediate benefits of improved tree canopy and workforce development, we anticipate several additional positive outcomes:
-
Enhanced Community Cohesion:
 Tree planting events and educational workshops will promote community engagement and collaboration, fostering stronger social ties among residents.

Increased Biodiversity:
Expanding the urban tree canopy will contribute to greater biodiversity, supporting various species of birds, insects, and other wildlife that enrich our ecosystem.

Climate Resilience:
A robust tree canopy can mitigate the urban heat island effect, manage stormwater runoff, and enhance our community’s resilience against climate change impacts.

Public Awareness and Education:
Our project will involve educational outreach to schools, community groups, and local government, fostering a greater understanding of the importance of urban forestry and sustainability practices.

In conclusion, our vision for the Tree Canopy and Workforce Development Project is multi-faceted, emphasizing community engagement, environmental justice, and economic opportunity. By enhancing urban green spaces, we are not only improving the quality of life for residents but also providing valuable job training and development opportunities. Together, we can build a sustainable future that prioritizes health, equity, and environmental stewardship for all community members. This project will stand as a meaningful model for integrating ecological initiatives with workforce development, serving as a catalyst for positive change in our community.",32 E 69th Street , ,Chicago ,IL,60637,32 E 69th Street , ,Chicago ,IL,60637,"The project will feature hands-on workshops that teach vital skills such as tree planting, maintenance, pruning techniques, and pest management. Participants, including community members and aspiring forestry professionals, will gain practical experience and certifications, enhancing their employability.","Planting will be scheduled in optimal seasons (fall or early spring) to reduce stress on the trees.

Our site preparation consists of clear the planting site of grass, weeds, and debris. Soil will be tested and amended as necessary. We also plan to apply 2-3 inches of organic mulch (e.g., wood chips, bark) around the base of each tree, extending at least 2 feet from the trunk. This helps retain moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature.

Our organization plans to establish a routine for watering each newly planted tree. Each tree will receive 10 gallons of water once a week during the growing season (April to October). Water will be applied using a drip system or soaker hose where possible; otherwise, watering bags or buckets will be employed to ensure deep consistent watering.

Education and Training
Responsibility:
Volunteers and community members involved in planting will be trained on proper planting techniques, watering schedules, and initial care.

Educational Materials:
Provide printed instructions or flyers outlining care routines.

4. Responsibilities for Maintenance
Local Volunteers and Students:
 Identify local schools, community organizations, and environmental groups to participate in long-term maintenance. A volunteer coordinator will be appointed to manage these efforts and schedule regular maintenance workdays.

Year 2: Growth and Nurturing Phase
1. Continued Care (Mulching)
Monitoring:
Check mulch levels and replenish as necessary to maintain a 2-3 inch layer, ensuring it stays clear of the tree trunk to prevent rot.

2. Watering
Ongoing Schedule:
  - Continue watering at the same rate (10 gallons per tree, weekly) for the full growing season.
  - Implement a monitoring system (e.g., rain gauges) to assess if adjustments are needed based on precipitation.

3. Education for Maintenance
Ongoing Training:
Organize workshops for volunteers and community members on tree care topics, such as:
  - Signs of tree stress or disease.
  - Techniques for pruning and shaping young trees.
  - Education on pests and diseases affecting local trees.

Field Trips: 
Arrange for visits to local tree nurseries or arboretums for hands-on training.

4. Responsibilities for Long-Term Maintenance

Community Stewardship Groups: Formalize community stewardship groups that will take responsibility for the ongoing care of trees in their neighborhoods. These groups will be provided with training and resources.

Year 3: Monitoring and Sustaining Phase
1. Assessment of Health
Monitoring Plan:
  - Conduct health assessments twice a year to evaluate tree growth, health, and potential disease or pest issues.
  - Use a checklist that includes checking for signs of wilt, discoloration, aphids, or disease.

2. Continued Watering
Adaptation: Assess the established trees’ water needs. Trees may require less water than in previous years as they develop more extensive root systems. 
Watering Schedule: Watering can be reduced to bi-weekly or as needed, especially during periods of significant rainfall.

3. Educational Workshops

Advanced Training: 
Conduct advanced workshops focusing on tree maturity care, including proper pruning techniques, long-term pest management, and soil health.

Sharing Best Practices:
 Create a ‘tree care guide’ based on learning from participants in the previous years which can be distributed to volunteers and community members.

4. Monitoring and Accountability
Responsibility Assignments:
Identify and assign specific individuals or community groups to monitor and report on tree health quarterly.

Long-Term Stewardship Program:
Formulate a partnership with local environmental organizations or tree care specialists to assist with ongoing support; consider creating internship opportunities for students.

This detailed three-year planting and maintenance plan is designed to ensure the successful establishment of the tree canopy while promoting community engagement and education. Through consistent watering, mulching, and training, we strive to cultivate a thriving urban forest that will provide long-lasting environmental and social benefits.

Arthur Lockhart Resource Institute,15.0,"The project will involve planting 15 native trees, carefully selected for their ecological benefits, adaptability to urban environments, and aesthetic appeal. The species include oak, maple, and redbud trees, which offer shade, improve air quality, and enhance the visual landscape. The trees will be strategically planted in public spaces such as community centers, schools, and sidewalks to maximize their environmental and social benefits.

The project will include workshops and training sessions for community members, educating them on the importance of urban forestry, tree care, and the role of green spaces in promoting mental and physical health. Special focus will be given to involving underserved populations, including seniors and veterans, ensuring they have opportunities to actively participate in the project.

A critical aspect of the project is providing job training for local residents, including veterans, in urban forestry skills. Participants will learn tree planting, maintenance, and environmental stewardship, empowering them with valuable skills for employment opportunities.

ALRI will implement a comprehensive maintenance plan to ensure the survival and growth of the trees. This includes watering, mulching, and regular inspections by trained volunteers and staff. Partnerships with local arborists and tree nurseries will support the technical aspects of the project.

The My Healing Space project goes beyond tree planting to create a sense of community pride, improve public health, and foster environmental awareness. By greening urban spaces, ALRI aims to address critical challenges like urban heat islands, air pollution, and limited access to green spaces while providing meaningful workforce opportunities.

Ultimately, this project seeks to create a legacy of environmental stewardship and social well-being, enhancing the quality of life for all residents in Austin.","The My Healing Space initiative envisions creating an urban oasis that fosters environmental sustainability, mental well-being, and workforce empowerment in the Austin communities. This project aims to blend urban forestry with social equity, addressing systemic inequalities while providing tangible environmental and social benefits to an underserved population.
Who Will Benefit and In What Ways
 * Community Members:
Residents of the Austin neighborhood will experience a greener, healthier urban environment. Trees provide numerous benefits, including improved air quality, reduced urban heat island effects, and a calming natural aesthetic, which has been shown to lower stress and foster mental well-being. These communities, often characterized by high levels of poverty and limited green spaces, will gain access to a serene environment that serves as a gathering space for healing, reflection, and connection.
 * Local Organizations and Schools:
Partnering with schools and community organizations ensures access to these green spaces for educational activities, outdoor learning, and community events. Students will benefit from hands-on environmental education, cultivating a sense of responsibility toward nature.

Through the workforce development program, local veterans and unemployed residents will receive training in tree planting, care, and maintenance. Participants will gain valuable skills, boosting employability in the green economy and related fields.
 * Vulnerable Populations:
Seniors, veterans, and residents with limited mobility will benefit from shaded pathways, accessible green spaces, and the opportunity to participate in community-building activities that promote physical and mental health.
Supporting Environmental Justice in the Community
The Austin neighborhood are historically underserved areas, facing disproportionate exposure to environmental degradation and a lack of green infrastructure. The My Healing Space initiative directly addresses this inequity by introducing 15 native trees—oak, maple, and redbud—strategically planted to maximize environmental benefits. 
This project aligns with environmental justice principles by:
 * Reducing Air Pollution: Trees act as natural air filters, absorbing pollutants and improving the overall air quality in communities that face higher rates of respiratory issues.
 * Combating Urban Heat: The tree canopy will provide shade and lower surface temperatures, reducing the impact of urban heat islands in areas with limited tree cover.
 * Community Ownership: Engaging residents in the planning, planting, and maintenance processes fosters a sense of ownership and empowerment, ensuring long-term sustainability.
Workforce Development in the Community
My Healing Space emphasizes workforce development as a core component, providing opportunities for local veterans, unemployed residents, and youth to gain practical skills and experience.
 * Training and Employment:
Participants will receive training in tree planting, site preparation, and ongoing maintenance, with a focus on best practices in urban forestry. This hands-on experience equips them with skills that are increasingly in demand as the green economy grows.
 * Skill Building for Veterans:
Veterans, who often face barriers to re-entry into the workforce, will benefit from targeted recruitment and tailored training programs. These activities also provide therapeutic benefits, as working in nature has been shown to improve mental health and resilience.
 * Job Creation and Economic Growth:
The project will create immediate jobs for tree planting and maintenance while opening pathways to long-term employment in landscaping, environmental conservation, and urban forestry management.
 * Partnerships with Local Organizations:
Collaboration with local nonprofits and workforce development agencies will ensure participants receive comprehensive support, including job placement assistance and access to additional training resources.
My Healing Space offers numerous additional benefits beyond its primary goals. By creating a serene green space, the project promotes mental health and well-being, reducing stress and anxiety among residents. It also serves as an educational platform, enabling local schools and youth groups to learn about environmental sustainability and biodiversity. Furthermore, the project fosters community cohesion by involving residents in its development and organizing community events. By introducing a robust tree canopy, the space contributes to climate resilience, mitigating the impacts of climate change. Finally, the aesthetic enhancement of the area can inspire further revitalization efforts and attract investment.",4941 W Chicago Ave, ,Chicago,IL,60651,4941 W Chicago Ave, ,Chicago,IL,60651,"The My Healing Space project actively integrates urban and community forestry workforce development into its core design. By addressing environmental justice and employment disparities in the Austin community, the project seeks to create a sustainable workforce pipeline that not only supports the maintenance of urban forestry but also empowers individuals with valuable skills and job opportunities.

A central focus of the project is to recruit and train individuals, particularly from underserved communities, to participate in urban forestry initiatives. Workforce trainees will receive hands-on training in tree planting, maintenance, and care, equipping them with practical knowledge and certifications in urban forestry and arboriculture. This training will be led by experienced professionals and include education on the environmental significance of urban forestry, proper tree care techniques, and the use of specialized equipment.

Participants will gain experience in tree planting, mulching, pruning, and other essential maintenance tasks. To ensure a comprehensive understanding, trainees will also learn about pest and disease management, soil health, and the broader ecological impact of trees on urban environments. These skills will position them for employment opportunities with municipal forestry programs, landscaping companies, and environmental nonprofits.

Long-Term Workforce Impact
The workforce development aspect of the project will have lasting effects on the community. Participants will not only gain employable skills but will also become advocates for urban forestry and environmental stewardship within their neighborhoods. Their efforts will enhance the tree canopy, improve public health, and contribute to environmental resilience, fostering a culture of care for urban green spaces.

Moreover, the program’s focus on job creation and skills development aligns with broader efforts to build a green economy. By investing in workforce development, My Healing Space contributes to a more sustainable future, where community members can thrive both economically and environmentally.","To ensure the successful establishment, growth, and long-term health of the trees planted through the My Healing Space project, a comprehensive three-year planting and maintenance plan has been developed. The plan incorporates best practices for urban forestry, education for caregivers, and a community-driven approach to tree stewardship.

Planting will occur in April 2025 to align with the growing season. We will select 15 native trees from the Faith in Place-approved species list, prioritizing those suited to urban environments and local climate conditions. Prior to planting, the site will undergo soil testing and amendment as needed, along with the removal of stumps or debris to create clear planting areas. Tree pits will be prepared to ensure optimal root growth. During planting, we will apply 2-4 inches of organic mulch around each tree, carefully avoiding direct contact with the tree trunk. Trees will be spaced appropriately to allow for mature canopy development and staked only if necessary.

To support watering needs, each tree will receive 10 gallons of water weekly during the growing season, using slow-release watering bags or manual methods by workforce trainees and volunteers. Watering frequency will adjust for heavy rainfall or cooler months in subsequent years. Mulching will be replenished twice annually, and soil conditions will be monitored to address compaction or erosion. Trees will also undergo light pruning starting in the second year to encourage healthy growth, while trained workforce members will inspect trees monthly for pests, disease, or damage, applying treatments as necessary.

Education will play a pivotal role in ensuring the long-term health of the trees. Community volunteers will attend workshops covering tree health, watering techniques, and pest identification, while workforce trainees will receive hands-on training that leads to certifications in tree planting and maintenance. Local residents will be encouraged to ""adopt"" a tree, fostering a sense of ownership and responsibility. We will also use public tree-planting events to engage the community and provide educational opportunities led by certified arborists.

Over the three years, Arthur Lockhart Resource Institute (ALRI) staff will oversee implementation and monitoring, while workforce participants will handle day-to-day maintenance. Community volunteers will assist with watering and mulching, and a digital tracking system will document maintenance activities and tree growth to ensure accountability and allow adjustments as needed.

Potential challenges include insufficient watering, pest outbreaks, reduced community participation, and vandalism or neglect. To address these, we will install slow-release watering systems, partner with local forestry experts, maintain ongoing education and engagement events, and install signage to encourage community stewardship. By the end of the three-year period, we expect all 15 trees to be thriving, workforce trainees to have gained valuable skills and certifications, and community members to feel a greater sense of environmental responsibility. The urban canopy will deliver measurable benefits, such as reduced heat, improved air quality, and increased biodiversity, ensuring the long-term success of the project.","['oak', 'maple', 'redbud']","{'Oak': 5, 'Maple': 5, 'Redbud': 5}","['Create an urban oasis fostering environmental sustainability, mental well-being, and workforce empowerment in Austin communities.', 'Improve air quality and reduce urban heat island effects through strategic tree planting.', 'Provide access to greener, healthier urban environments for underserved community members.', 'Enhance educational activities and outdoor learning opportunities for schools and organizations.', 'Offer workforce development training in tree planting, care, and maintenance for veterans and unemployed residents.', 'Empower local veterans and residents with valuable skills to boost employability in the green economy.', 'Support vulnerable populations with shaded pathways, accessible green spaces, and community-building activities.', 'Address environmental degradation and lack of green infrastructure in historically underserved areas.', 'Engage residents in planning, planting, and maintenance processes for community ownership.', 'Create immediate and long-term employment opportunities in landscaping, conservation, and urban forestry management.', 'Establish partnerships with local organizations for job placement assistance and additional training resources.']"

1 Basswood, 
2 Tuliptrees, 
3 Serviceberry, 
2 Eastern Redbud, 
3 Pagoda Dogwood,

2 Fringe Trees

All of these trees are recommended for our area. M&M Tree Service helped us identify our current trees and discussed some possibilities for future trees. M&M will trim the overhanging trees from other properties in early spring. The Green Team surveyed our congregation to see what they would like to have on the grounds. Last Sunday, 17 November, we presented our choices to our congregation, had a great discussion, and finalized the plan. Several topics became apparent during this discussion, which helped determine the final decisions.

Members did not want to plant trees close to the building because of plans for solar. They wanted trees to make a manageable mess, so we located the Shagbark away from the building. Many members like flowering trees, and so do pollinators, so many of the trees flower. The congregation is concerned about safety, including site lines and misuse of the property, and would like shade. 

Carrie Hennesey, a landscape designer from Johnson's Nursery, came on-site to advise. We discussed the congregation's ideas, the individual trees, our site, light, and placement. Like most of Milwaukee, our ground is mostly landfill. The large mound/berm east of the parking lot has rendered a large property area useless. We have tried to remove sod previously and add pollinators, but the ground is full of rock and other debris. We need to flatten it and plant trees. The mound stretches the entire area where the Chinkapin Oak, Basswood, Tuliptrees, and Eastern Redbud will go.We plan to eliminate grass in that area, replant with bee grass or another alternative grass, and create a walking path and gathering space. 

We were initially going to plant three apples on the north side where we are going to plant the fringe trees, but after discussing with the extension, we decided that the pines to the east would block the needed morning light. We chose a fringe tree due to its size and its flowers. The hornbeam will be placed as a specimen tree, creating yearlong interest, and the serviceberries will be planted by the rain garden, helping to create a serene gathering space. The children can pick these berries, as well as the birds. We ordered Bringing Nature Home by Douglas Tallamay, which we will use to help develop the curriculum for this summer. ","All of Creation will benefit from this project. It is our prayer that it will create a ripple effect and that people will find ways to participate in restoring our planet. Most community members struggle to keep the roof above their heads and the lights on. Climate change seems far away from them, and there is a sense of powerlessness and avoidance of the issues. The economic and social conditions are coupled with a damaged relationship with nature due to historical trauma and a lack of safety in the neighborhood. Milwaukee, the 'good land,' was once a wetland teaming with fish, beaver, and wild rice. It is rare that people even know that we are built on top of streams and marshes. People often draw the shades in their homes and never look out. 

We know that a relationship with nature can heal the body, mind, and soil. The Belonging Place Garden is and will become even more of a place of respite, as people can sit beneath the branches of the basswood, smelling its fragrance, or see hummingbirds sipping nectar from the tulip tree. We know environmental justice is intersectional and that ultimately, whether it is a health concern, water, air, soil pollution, economic disparity, racism, sexism, homophobia, or violence, it all falls under environmental justice. One of the blatant symbols of injustice is the difference between communities that have trees and those that have not and how that has impacted people's lives and the earth we walk upon. 

There is a shortage of workers in the green industry, and more careers are created every day, but if you are in a neighborhood that never looks at the sky, how can you know or relate to the importance of these jobs? If your relationship with the earth has been damaged, how could you even consider being an urban farmer when your grandparents were sharecroppers or forced into slavery? The endeavor to plant trees is an endeavor to heal ourselves, restore ourselves as we restore the planet, and develop skills, interests, and love for God's creation that sparks a new reality of mental and physical health and economic recovery founded in love for God's creation and each other. 

The trees are young, like the children. If the children help care for the trees, draw them, speak to them, and hear from them, they will grow alongside the trees and remember when the Oak standing tall was just a sapling. We can introduce young people to careers they have yet to encounter. Careers that pay well and help the planet. And help build skills to be resilient in the face of climate change. The children will see the changes in the flora and fauna. They will notice the difference in temperature between the shade and the cement. And learn how to grow as they grow. And breathe deep because there are trees. We can not predict which children will enter forestry or become naturalists, environmental engineers, scientists, artists who expose the present and point to the future, or teachers who tell tree stories. We know that third graders are energetic and intelligent, and if they are continually wrapped in creation's arms throughout their early school years, they will have a vision that sees the flower growing instead of the litter in the street. The trees are for the children. 

And the trees are for the youth. The youth who take an Employ Milwaukee job for six weeks in the summer to get a paycheck end up learning that they like taking care of trees, growing and eating plant-based food, assisting with teaching and helping younger children, and meeting scientists, and arborists, environmental engineers, and green artists and activists, green builders and contractors, teachers and farmers that look like them. Perhaps the youth might consider choosing a career that takes care of their needs and simultaneously helps the planet. 

The trees are for the young adult intern, who starts off thinking they are just taking a summer job, working in the garden but soon realize that they are teachers, that they are interested in community development, and that there are many opportunities for them to align their training to enter careers doing something positive for planet and people. Some feel deep anxiety because the blinders of what is happening in the world are off, and they see the writing on the wall, losing hope while realizing that we are the cause of climate change and figuring out that being part of the solution brings hope.

And there is the person who has recently become sober, who maybe has not found their way back from trauma, who feels the bark on the musclewood tree hears the birds chirping in the service, and finds meaning in healing at the moment. 

Who benefits? Every person with asthma, diabetes, anxiety, depression, lack of healthy food, limited or no resources. Every person is suffering under the yoke of isms or has become so distant that they no longer experience a connection to God or nature. And the planet, which has been treated as badly as the people have been treated. The trees are for all of us.

Build capacity and longevity",3295 N Dr Martin Luther King Jr Dr, ,Milwaukee,WI,53212,3295 N Dr Martin Luther King Jr Dr, ,Milwaukee,WI,53212,"Our strategy is to start young and excite interest in going green. Everything from bicycles, metal water bottles, plant-based food, expression through the arts, environmental lessons, hands-on nature experiences, nature field trips, performances and exhibitions, working with artists and teachers, and guest speakers who are role models who care about and nurture their curiosity are employed. Our SPLASH program is designed to engage ages 8-14 and present possibilities. We also bring nature into our Sunday school lessons because we have some of the same students. We are creating gathering spaces for bible studies and environmental lessons. Children are exposed to and encouraged to connect with nature, people who love nature, and interact with role models from different careers.

Step two is to employ youth workers. To give them meaningful work that is beyond their everyday experience. They experience all of the activities the younger children do, but an additional layer involves research, study, and exposure to many blue/green careers. They participate in the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District's Water Journeys, go on special field trips, visit organizations, help with younger children, and take care of the gardens. They also have the opportunity to attend the Green and Healthy Schools Conference. If they are interested, we refer them to ReFlo, Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District, Groundworks, Johnson's Nursery, vocational colleges and universities, Nearby Nature, Red, Bike & Green Bicycle Club for future internships, recreation, and further education. UW Milwaukee has the only Freshwater Science Department in the country. 

Step Three: Internships. Young adults experience all the above but plan what will happen, supervise, teach, and facilitate. They are intricately involved with deciding curriculum, developing lessons, classroom management, and helping make decisions about the grounds. They have additional opportunities to go to conferences, visit programs, and have opportunities to research, study, and discuss environmental issues. Often, they start with a general idea of where they are headed but refine their direction. The interns receive additional support to find scholarships, job referrals, and references. 

Strategy Four: Volunteerism. Our community site provides service opportunities for people in school or who need to spend time in the community, helping them satisfy their requirements, build their resumes, and gain referrals. We have a sober house interested in working with us, and previously, church members have worked with different facilities and organizations. 

Strategy Five: We purposefully hire companies owned by or employed by underrepresented people. We are working with Green Congregations to develop relationships with contractors who employ and train people from our community. We realize that if we collaborate and can offer a business a series of jobs rather than one, there is a better chance that the company will hire someone who needs to enter the workforce. We are in close connection with other organizations who are concerned about workforce development in the community. We are a good entry point to move on to other organizations or businesses or continued education.","Depending on the weather, Johnson's Nursery will plant and mulch the trees between April and May. Because of the condition of our ground and its need for preparation, the average age of the members of our congregation, and our lack of expertise, we will contract with Johnson's to do the initial planting and mulching. We will be on the grounds, learn from them, and help when appropriate. We will add identification/information signs for each tree, including QR codes, so people can learn more if interested.

As needed, we will rely on the UW Extension, Johnson's Nursery, and MATC Horticulture Department for guidance, purchase recommended books, and use reputable sourced research online. I am confident that everyone on our Green Team will be willing to learn, resourceful, and seek out information. We often go down rabbit holes. The US Forest Service's Tree Owner Manual, recommended above, explains the steps we need to take and when we need to take them. Our Green Team will read this manual together before the trees arrive. We will follow the advice given and be aware of every step. We understand that the first three years are crucial to establishing the trees and that they will continue to need moderate care afterward, depending on their size. I have read that the larger the tree, the longer it takes to establish its roots.  

Developing a tree canopy is important for Milwaukee. We may be able to invite a speaker or offer a workshop on native trees as a member of the Harambee ECO Neighborhood Team. We will create a manual that will identify the needs of each tree, including soil type, water needs according to caliper, pruning schedule, common diseases and pests, how long each tree will take to establish according to size, and how to treat them organically. This will help us learn, as well as provide information for future care. The manual will include interesting information about the tree, such as how insects and mammals benefit from it, whether pollinator or host,  its medicinal properties, economic uses, and cultural history. For example, Chinkapin oak means chestnut in Algonquin; Serviceberry has been used medicinally and was pounded into venison to make pemican, aka jerky. 

We will protect the trees from mowers with a large mulch circle and stake the trees or use other protective means as necessary, including wrapping trunks from animals and human threats. We are considering incorporating biochar but need to do more research and look for professional sources. We will refresh the mulch in the fall after it freezes. And prune in the winter. And refresh the mulch again in the spring. This article from Penn State explains the process of mulching well. https://extension.psu.edu/mulching-landscape-trees#:

We will include the trees in our established watering schedule. We are considering TreeGators, rain gauges, and water flow meters. We generally water the front one day and back the next unless we receive rain. We are used to this commitment. We will watch the trees for signs of stress, especially in hot weather, and not overwater. We are also establishing other native plants. We are consulting with the Xerces Society for the Protection of Invertebrates and applying for their grant, and we will be planting companion plants to the trees and for part sun. We noticed this summer that even though it takes more extended hand watering rather than using sprinklers, it requires interacting with the plant, and it is easier to observe changes and wastes less water. 

Trees will be part of this summer's SPLASH program, 'Let's Bloom Where We Are Planted.' We will research trees to teach about them, develop resources, and find an appropriate curriculum, including a curriculum for high school Earn & Learn students that teaches about green careers. We will teach about the water cycle as well. There is a saying, ""If you want to learn something, teach it."" This is very true. When you understand a subject, you can break it down and explain it to someone else. On Saturdays during the summer, children will use watering cans and water from the IBC units to help water. After watering, there will be an opportune time for tree lessons; the trees are teachers. 

There are many stories about trees and a tradition of storytelling under a tree, particularly the Baobob. I look forward to sitting with children, enjoying the shade, connecting to the earth, and gathering ancestral wisdom. We will not neglect the spiritual nature of trees and God's creation. Some of our trees will be purposefully planted in three to support each other,  libations poured, and trees blessed; the congregation and community will be invited; this will be part of our learning as well. We will understand the life-sustaining force of trees and how deep the roots must go to be healthy and strong. 

Solomon's Trustee Board is ultimately responsible for the grounds in the long term. However, it has been evident since we began the transformation of our grounds into The Belonging Place Garden, the commitment of the present volunteers, interns, and community that the trees will be well loved and cared for. M&M Tree Service has been our arborist for the last several years. Johnson's Nursery knows us as well. Kayla and Cameron know a tremendous amount about what is established and planned. The most important thing we can do this year is to record this endeavor and develop information that explains what is planted, when, where, and why we planted a particular tree, and how to care for the tree and the surrounding vegetation. And collect stories.

Inspired by the Jewish holiday Tu B’Shevat, which celebrates renewal and growth through tree planting, the Abel Project seeks to create living memorials for children and other victims of violence in our cities. This initiative addresses pressing social and environmental issues while fostering hope, resilience, and justice.The primary beneficiaries of the Abel Project are the families of victims of violence, their communities, and the broader environment.
 * Families of Victims
  * Emotional Healing: Families who have lost loved ones to violence often grapple with immense grief and a sense of injustice. By planting a tree in memory of their loved one, the Abel Project provides a lasting, meaningful tribute, offering solace and a place for reflection.
  * Community Solidarity: These events bring families together with neighbors, fostering collective mourning and the shared goal of building a safer, more united community.
 * Community Members
  * Beautification and Safety: Planting trees in areas affected by violence not only serves as a reminder of lives lost but also beautifies and revitalizes these spaces, signaling hope and renewal. Well-maintained green spaces have been shown to reduce crime and create a stronger sense of belonging among residents.
  * Educational Opportunities: By engagingour youth in the tree-planting process, the project promotes environmental awareness and teaches participants about the importance of urban forestry.
 * The Broader Environment
  * Environmental Benefits: Each tree planted contributes to cleaner air, reduced urban heat, and increased biodiversity. These benefits are particularly significant in communities disproportionately affected by environmental injustice, where green spaces are often lacking.Environmental JusticeThe Abel Project supports environmental justice by prioritizing tree planting in underserved communities most impacted by violence and environmental neglect. These neighborhoods often experience:
 * Urban Heat Islands: Lack of tree cover leads to higher temperatures, exacerbating health disparities.
 * Pollution: Increased exposure to air pollutants can result in respiratory issues and other health problems.
 * Green Space Inequities: Limited access to parks and natural areas deprives residents of the psychological and physical benefits of greenery.By planting trees with red leaves—symbolizing the blood shed by victims—the project transforms sites of tragedy into symbols of hope and renewal. These memorials also draw attention to systemic issues, advocating for investment in marginalized neighborhoods.

Workforce Development  The Abel Project has the potential to support workforce development in several key ways:
 * MASK Tree and Lawn Maintainance Co.
  * This project equips individuals with skills in urban forestry, landscaping, and environmental stewardship, opening pathways to employment. We will utilize the participants in an ongoing Urban Landscape maintenance Program, to facilitate a community owned business.
 * Engaging Local Businesses
  * By sourcing trees from local nurseries and hiring licensed landscapers, the Abel Project creates opportunities for small businesses and contractors, stimulating the local economy.
 * Youth Engagement
  * Collaborations with schools and youth organizations introduce young people to careers in environmental science, horticulture, and conservation. Hands-on involvement in tree planting builds a sense of responsibility and sparks interest in green careers.Additional Potential Benefits In addition to its direct impacts, the Abel Project envisions broader social and environmental benefits:
 * Building Community Resilience
  * Through collective action, the project fosters a culture of care and accountability, inspiring residents to reclaim and transform their neighborhoods.
 * Raising Awareness
  * The symbolic nature of red-leafed trees draws attention to the prevalence of violence and the need for systemic change, encouraging policymakers and stakeholders to invest in prevention strategies.

Tree Planting Plan
Site Preparation

Collaborate withour staff  to identify appropriate planting locations.
Conduct soil testing to evaluate conditions and determine if amendments are needed to support tree growth.
Clear the planting site of debris and prepare the soil for optimal aeration and drainage.

Tree Selection
We will use a well-adapted species with red leaves (Northern Red Oak)  to symbolize the victims’ lives lost.
Select trees grown by local nurseries to ensure they are suited to Chicago’s climate and soil conditions.
Planting Process

Timing: Plant trees during the dormant season (early spring or fall) to reduce transplant shock.
Planting Steps:
Dig a hole twice the width and slightly shallower than the tree’s root ball.
Remove the tree from its container or burlap, loosening roots to prevent girdling.
Position the tree so that the root flare is at ground level.
Backfill the hole with native soil, gently tamping it down to remove air pockets.
Apply 2–3 inches of organic mulch around the base, leaving a gap around the trunk to prevent rot.
Staking: Stake the tree only if necessary (e.g., in high-wind areas) and remove the stakes after one year to avoid girdling.
Watering Plan
Weekly Watering Schedule

Provide 10 gallons of water per tree each week during the growing season (April through October). Adjust for rainfall to avoid overwatering.
Watering Methods

Install slow-release watering bags for consistent moisture.
Train volunteers or local youth to perform manual watering for areas without access to irrigation systems.
Drought Management

During periods of drought, increase watering frequency and monitor trees closely for signs of stress, such as wilting or leaf drop.
Education and Training
Educational Workshops

Partner with organizations like Open Lands Chicago and the US Forest Service to host training sessions for volunteers, families, and community members responsible for tree maintenance.
Topics include:
Proper mulching and watering techniques.
Recognizing signs of pest infestation or disease.

United Congregations of Metro East,20.0,"The tree planting project we would focus on is a section of approximately 6 blocks of Madison Avenue in Granite City, Illinois.  The Right-of-Ways (ROWs) that run between the street and the sidewalk are currently deficient of trees.  There was a time that trees were plentiful on this main street, but there has been little replacement of what has been lost over the years.  The City recently removed several mature trees due to buckling sidewalks that created risk.  We project that 20 trees could be planted along the 6 blocks.  The following list includes ROW approved trees from which we will select the trees to plant:
Northern Catalpa
Hackberry
Kentucky Coffeetree
Oak species
 American Sycamore (received approval from Faith in Place 11/18/24)
 Thornless Honeylocust (received approval from Faith in Place 11/18/24)
 Sugarberry (received approval from Faith in Place 11/18/24)    
 We see this project as involving members of the community, the City, contractors, non-profit organizations, and environmental groups.  We will communicate through social media and distribute informational brochures about the project to the community.  We will contact non-profits, local schools, churches, and small businesses with which to build our workforce.  This workforce will have the opportunity to experience a hands-on experience of early tree care that may inspire an individual or two to pursue a career in urban forestry.  

Our tree planting and maintenance project goes far beyond just watering the trees.  The Workforce we create will have a unique opportunity to experience a long-term commitment to caring for trees.  Our workforce will have the chance to work with professionals who will instruct them on how to plant, stake, guard, mulch, and water the trees at the planting location.  Throughout the program, the Workforce will have the opportunity to learn what to look for when accessing the health of the trees.  They will learn the importance of documenting the trees' progress and communicating those findings. Our workforce of individuals who love working outdoors may wish to learn more about urban forestry and might seek to continue their education.  If one likes to be high up in the trees to prune, that will come with time and training.  We will consider recruiting youth and school organizations and formerly incarcerated individuals within the community interested in learning the basics of urban forestry.  ","There is great pleasure to be experienced when planting and caring for a tree. The simple gesture of planting a tree brings with it benefits to all in its proximity, but also the benefits reach into the bigger world. Trees can help to mitigate the effects of global warming. Trees are good for our mental health. When trees are planted, other life quickly moves in. Years from now, when the City tree canopy has grown, shade will cool our sidewalks in the summer and help to cool our homes. Disadvantaged community members do not have the money or the means to plant a tree and many will welcome a tree on their ROW. We are hopeful that after the three-year tree plan, the individuals who receive a tree on their ROW property will continue to care for the tree and alert the City of any problem with the tree that requires attention. Trees also increase property value. The City will benefit as it wants to be a welcoming and beautiful place to live. Our workforce will learn how to properly plant and care for trees opening them to new career opportunities.

Reducing Barriers to Employment: By providing these youth with paid work experience, job training, and certifications (such as NABCEP), the project helps reduce common barriers to employment, such as lack of work history, insufficient qualifications, and limited access to professional networks.
Environmental Stewardship and Job Creation: As a result of this program, there will be a greater number of trained young people who can contribute to the local economy through jobs in tree care, landscaping, energy efficiency, and sustainability.

By integrating urban and community forestry work with youth employment and job training, this project not only creates green spaces but also helps foster the development of a local workforce ready to engage in sustainable, meaningful work in the growing green economy. The combination of hands-on environmental stewardship and job readiness training will directly contribute to workforce development in the East Central neighborhood, while also addressing environmental justice issues that have historically affected the community.","Planting and Maintenance Plan

Our tree planting and maintenance plan is designed to ensure the long-term survival and health of the trees in the East Central neighborhood’s Labyrinth Healing Park. By following best practices for urban forestry, engaging trained personnel and volunteers, and implementing an educational program, we aim to create a sustainable green space that will provide ongoing environmental and social benefits for years to come.

 Goals
1. Successful Establishment of Trees: Proper planting and mulching for each tree to support initial growth.
2. Consistent Watering and Nutrient Support: A watering schedule of 10 gallons per tree each week during the growing season to ensure adequate moisture.
3. Community Education and Engagement: Educational workshops for those responsible for long-term tree maintenance to ensure sustainable care.
4. Ongoing Tree Health Monitoring: A system to monitor and address any tree health issues proactively.

 Budget Overview
Youth Stipends for 10-week Program: Each youth receives $100 per week for 10 weeks, totaling $20,000 for the 20 youth in the summer program.
Tree Purchase: The purchase of 20 trees at $200 each totals $4,000 to cover the costs of planting the trees.

Watering Supplies: This budget covers the cost of watering 20 trees (10 gallons/tree/week) for each of the 3 years, with an estimated total of $750 for 3 years.
Youth Watering & Maintenance Labor: The budget allocates $2,000 over 3 years for youth stipends to continue watering and maintaining the trees. Youth will be engaged in this task for 10 weeks each year, receiving $25 per week. 

Tree Selection and Placement  
We have selected five native, drought-resistant fruit trees (apple, pear, and cherry) suited for the region’s climate. These trees were chosen to provide food, shade, and air quality benefits to the community.
  
Each tree will be planted according to the following process:
- Soil Preparation: Digging a hole twice the diameter of the root ball and deep enough to accommodate the entire root system. Soil amendments will be added if necessary to improve drainage and nutrient content.
- Planting Depth: Trees will be planted so that the top of the root ball is level with the surrounding soil, preventing root rot and promoting strong root growth.
- Mulching: A 3-inch layer of organic mulch will be applied in a 3-foot diameter around each tree. Mulch helps retain soil moisture, suppresses weeds, and improves soil structure. Mulch will be kept 3 inches away from the tree trunk to prevent moisture buildup.

Workshops will be conducted in the spring, summer, and fall of the first year, followed by bi-annual refresher sessions in years two and three. Participants will include local volunteers, residents, and youth members from the PBC Green Team, empowering the community to take active responsibility in park upkeep.

Tree health monitoring and maintenance will be carried out regularly to ensure long-term survival and vitality. Responsibilities will be divided among a team of volunteers, the PBC Green Team members, and local community leaders, with oversight from a certified arborist consultant. An arborist will conduct an annual assessment of each tree to check for disease, structural issues, and overall health. This monitoring allows us to identify and address potential problems early, ensuring proactive tree care.

Seasonal Maintenance Routine  
During each growing season, the following routine will be followed: Spring: Inspection for winter damage, replacement of mulch, and application of slow-release organic fertilizer as needed. Summer: Monitoring soil moisture, maintaining the watering schedule, and removing weeds. Fall: Light pruning and preparation for winter (e.g., adjusting mulch to protect roots from frost).

Tree Health Interventions  
If issues such as pests, disease, or nutrient deficiencies are detected, the project team will consult with our arborist to determine the best course of action. This may include targeted treatments, soil amendments, or changes in watering practices to ensure tree recovery.


Engaging the community is essential for the success of our maintenance plan. By involving residents in tree care, we foster a sense of ownership, encouraging them to care for the park for years to come. We will organize seasonal maintenance days where community members can help with watering, mulching, and general upkeep. These events will include short tutorials on specific maintenance tasks, reinforcing knowledge and confidence in caring for the trees. The PBC Green Team youth members will play a pivotal role in maintenance, learning valuable skills in urban forestry. This involvement ensures that younger generations are invested in tree care and environmental stewardship, creating a sustainable foundation for future park upkeep.


To ensure the trees’ long-term survival and the continued success of the Labyrinth Healing Park, we are committed to securing sustainable funding and partnerships to support ongoing maintenance.

Funding and Partnerships  
We will pursue additional funding opportunities, such as local business sponsorships, community grants, and crowdfunding, to cover future maintenance costs. We will also partner with local environmental organizations and city programs that offer resources for urban forestry. After the initial three years, we aim to transition the primary maintenance responsibilities to local residents, supported by PBC Green Team alumni and community volunteers. By establishing a community advisory committee to oversee park maintenance, we ensure that the trees and park space remain a thriving, valued part of the East Central neighborhood","['apple', 'pear']","{'Red Maple': 3, 'Serviceberry': 3, 'Eastern Redbud': 3, 'Apple': 6, 'Pear': 6, 'Cherry': 6}","['Create an accessible, green space addressing environmental justice, workforce development, and community wellness in East Central neighborhood', 'Provide access to fresh fruit trees, shade, and a peaceful environment for wellness activities', 'Offer hands-on training in urban forestry, sustainable landscaping, and renewable energy fields for local youth', 'Develop career-ready skills among youth through pre-apprenticeship and apprenticeship programs', 'Provide hands-on training in tree planting, care, and sustainable landscaping practices', 'Empower residents to shape the future of their neighborhood through educational workshops and volunteer opportunities', 'Connect youth with internship and employment opportunities in green industries']"

The sanctuary will provide residents in the community with a safe space that includes thoughtful design with greenery, mosaics/art, a selection of flowers for pollinators and 5-10 varieties of trees planted to provide cool shade, an environmentally beneficial component inside the sanctuary.  Our project will demonstrate how urban forestry can enhance the quality of life in Englewood and promote environmental sustainability.  The plan will be executed in phases with most of the work in the sanctuary space starting in the Spring 2025 when weather permits.
We recognize that it’s not just about the optics, trees are pretty, but it’s also flood alleviation, erosion control, stormwater management.  All issues that also affect the Englewood community and knowing that the city planted significantly fewer trees in lower income communities of color on the South and West sides creates inequity. 
Planting these trees can help effect of residents at higher risk of excessive heat, flooding and poor air quality.","The vision for this area has many long-term benefits and is intended to empower the residents of the community, providing an urban oasis in an area that is in the grips of violence and healing from trauma. Englewood is a disadvantaged community with a population that faces significant economic challenges that are compounded by a greater exposure to environmental hazards. This disinvestment, among other factors, caused a decline in property ownership and an increase in vacant lots and unused space. Planting trees in this space will help heal the environment and the community allowing time for the earth to reset. Educating the next generation about agricultural impacts in Illinois and about the environmental history of the area and showing them how they can work to help remediate the soil etc. will support advocacy in the area. 
The Soulfull Blossums garden will provide the space to empower youth, serving as an educational tool, teaching the community about agricultural concepts, urban farming and soil remediation. We believe agriculture is important and many schools in our community are not equipped to host programs that focus on this critical issue. Our community exists in a food dessert and creating a better solution requires having an organized space we can designate to inspire and empower young innovators to find those solutions. Youth involvement in agriculture is essential for ensuring food security and it's important to have a new generation of farmers to meet future food demands. We are also choked by the trauma of violence; residents are not seen outside enjoying the weather or the peace of just sitting still among nature. We want to provide our congregation, the community and the next generation with an option, an area that will eliminate the stress of trauma and violence, if only for a moment in their day.

Programs and gatherings of various kinds occur at the House of Hospitality each week and month. Lunches and dinners for those we have met on the streets, gatherings for men and women to connect, retreats, training sessions, gatherings of other non-profits, and so much more happen at the House of Hospitality. One of the enduring comments that is heard upon entering this historic house is how peaceful it is. That is the atmosphere that we wish to create on the outside of the house as well as inside. Each person who comes to the house for a meeting, a program or gathering will be welcomed by a natural environment that is appealing and inviting. 

In terms of workforce development, area landscape companies will be employed to perform much of the work of stump removal, tree planting, and installation of berms and vegetation. A local young man who has a degree in forestry, yet struggles with mental illness, will be paid on a stipend basis for the work of planting the gardens and maintaining the other aspects of the property.

At present, the House of Hospitality, set in a light industrial area, stands out as a grand old house about which people are curious. The exterior of the house, with its sparse trees and grounds that are mostly covered by grass (and weeds), presents little eye appeal or intrigue. Once the Faith In Place Plan by Whatsoever You Do, Inc. is implemented, the old Atkinson House, now known as the Whatsoever You Do House of Hospitality, will be a focal point of Green Bay's westside and have people become more aware of how a property can be transformed with native plants and trees into a work of beauty.",1082 VELP AVE.,,GREEN BAY,WI,54303,1082 VELP AVE., ,GREEN BAY,WI,54303,"Our volunteer groundskeeper, a graduate of an institution of higher learning in central Wisconsin, holds a degree in forestry.

Greater Wabash Food Council,50.0,"Greater Wabash Food Council (GWFC), a 501(c)(3) agricultural education foundation, seeks $30,000 to plant 50 trees across two sites in Lawrence and White counties. The project will boost food production, train future arborists, and support conservation. Goals include providing fruit for a church community and addressing soil erosion and privacy concerns near a new subdivision.  

Both sites will plant Illinois native species of peach trees with 1-2"" trunks.  ","Currently, there are no certified arborists or tree professionals within a 300-mile radius of our region, leaving residents to rely solely on each other and the Extension office for tree care. This project seeks to address this gap by providing seasoned tree mentors offering training to the next generation of caretakers at both project sites. 

At the Lawrence County site, this initiative creates an opportunity for elders to pass down their knowledge in a hands-on “classroom” setting. Remaining true to their parish and community values, the Sumner Amish Community Church has traditionally relied on tree expertise from Pennsylvania, over 700 miles away. This project will help build local capacity, reducing reliance on distant resources. 

At the White County site, educational opportunities will be offered in partnership with Extension offices to teach tree planting, maintenance, and conservation practices to community members and the next generation. This project aligns with our strategic goals of incubating ten new agri-businesses across the region. Through partnerships with the Small Business Development Center (SBDC) and Wabash Valley College, we are designing an internship and entrepreneurial program complete with start-up support that will include arboriculture as a viable career path. The project will also serve as an educational destination for K-12 students in ten school districts, reaching over 11,000 students. 

By fostering a hands-on learning environment, we aim to inspire future arborists while promoting sustainability. At the core of our mission is the vision of building an ecosystem that supports honeybee populations and other pollinators. Each new flowering native tree planted is a step toward a healthier environment and a victory for conservation efforts. This project represents an investment in community resilience, sustainable food production, and environmental stewardship.","1152 Bob Martin Dr, ",,Carmi,Illinois,62821,PO Box 217, ,Bridgeport,IL,62417,"The White County project supports urban and community forestry workforce development by integrating tree care into a working urban farm. Located just outside of Carmi, Illinois, this farm faces challenges due to its proximity to new housing developments. To address concerns about erosion, the farm plans to plant rows of trees between crops and nearby homes. These trees will not only mitigate erosion but also provide shade and create a visual barrier. Seasonal workers on the farm will gain exposure to tree care and maintenance, learning valuable skills that can be applied in urban forestry careers.
Though the Lawrence County project is rural, it supports workforce development by introducing tree care education to the local Amish community. Their closest expert is over 700 miles away, so this initiative aims to train future generations within the community, cultivating local tree care expertise. This can create future opportunities for tree experts to serve the Sumner and surrounding areas.

Videos documenting the process will be shared on platforms like YouTube, and partnerships with SBDC and Extension offices will provide resources to nurture future arborists.  This type of video documentation could also be used for future economic development.

Bud union of the graft should be firm and clean
Tree is tagged with variety and rootstock
Thumb nail test- if you scratch a branch, is the wood underneath the scratch green?
Will you need to permanently stake this tree? (dwarf rootstocks)

Prune apples and pears in dormant season (Before leaves come out). Prune peaches, plums and cherries after bloom.
Review our Disease and Pest Management in the Home Orchard information, available on website and at nursery.
Familiarize yourself with useful, locally oriented disease and pest management sites like WSU Hortsense and PNW Pest Management Handbooks pages.
New growth- if growth is less than 18″ per year average per shoot then the tree might be lacking water and/or nutrients
Keep 3′-4′ area clean around trees first 7-8 years so voles/field mice don’t eat your tree’s roots.
Watering 1″ per week in the growing season is a good rule of thumb. Heavier soils may need less water, sandy soils more.
Check the soil moisture level to make sure you are watering enough: 24 hours after watering, dig 6″-8″ down and make sure soil is moist!
Train new shoots in late summer
Fruit– leave up to 6 fruit, remove all at ends of branches

Sheathed Inc,16.0,"This urban food forest project will include planting a fruiting tree orchard of apples, peach, pear and cherry. The locations for these trees will help increase urban tree canopy and provide a space for learning and healing. This project is also intended to create collaboration between various local organizations while teaching the importance of healthy soil, food diversity, invasive species awareness and the connection to mental health, gut health, trauma healing and whole-body health. This “healing orchard” will also be a space for community. Phases of the project include planning, ordering of trees, site preparation, tree planting and maintenance. Our workshops and events will promote community engagement through working and learning opportunities. We plan to teach and use urban soil health practices as well as promote native pollinators by planting plots around the orchard which will provide food and shelter to create a diverse ecosystem. Sheathed is dedicated to foster healing within marginalized populations through healthy living activities, such as planting trees. Currently, our organization is partnered with the Recovery Cafe Fort Wayne— an organization that serves those struggling with addiction. The locations of the tree project are as follows:
6 trees at Gren Park, 2699 Clifton Hills Dr., Fort Wayne IN 46808. This location is possible with permission
from the Parks and Rec department. Along with assistance from the neighborhood association we want to
organize events to help gain community input and buy in so that the orchard may thrive.

Planting trees provides a holistic modality to improve mental health. The members of Recovery Cafe have expressed an interest in this project. Further, our organization intends to engage in outreach efforts with the unhoused population in Fort Wayne. Ideally, transportation will be provided to those in need to allow them to attend workshops and trauma support groups. Engaging in tree planting fosters a deep connection with the natural world. This connection has been shown to reduce feelings of anxiety and depression. The physical act of digging, planting, and nurturing a tree allows individuals to immerse themselves in their environment, promoting mindfulness—an effective technique for combating mental health issues. Planting trees is a form of physical exercise. Studies consistently show that regular physical activity can help alleviate symptoms of depression and anxiety. Whether it's digging holes, carrying saplings, or watering them afterward, the physical movement involved in planting trees helps release endorphins, which are natural mood lifters. ""In addition to benefits that fresh air, physical exertion and natural beauty provide, Mycobacterium vaccae - a microbe naturally found in soil - is also improving people's temperaments."" [""Digging in the Dirt for Your Mental Well-Being"" Arbor Day Nov/Dec2024] This microbe can increase serotonin levels acting as an antidepressant. Tree planting is often a communal activity. Participating in community events geared toward planting trees not only helps create green spaces but also fosters social connections. Building friendships and networks through shared goals can combat loneliness and promote emotional well-being. Being part of a community effort creates a sense of belonging, which is crucial for mental health. In tandem with our tree planting efforts, we propose to host a series of educational workshops tailored for our community. These workshops will cover various topics such as:
-Mental health benefits of planting trees
-Sustainability practices
-Ecological benefits of planting trees

Who will benefit: urban neighborhoods; youth; underserved populations; unhoused persons; individuals struggling with trauma and/or mental health. The environment and the rivers.
Environmental Justice Support: engage and inform the community on conservation methods for urban residents. Supporting native species and biodiversity. Innervestment has a focus on soil health practices.
Support workforce development: Collaboration with partnering organizations and a youth training program. We will also complete outreach efforts with the unhoused population to encourage a working environment that will also benefit mental health. 
Additional benefits: increase awareness on native species, invasive species and benefits of pollinator plots, establishment of an urban food forest and community garden in neighborhoods who need them.",1410 High St.,,Fort Wayne,Indiana,46808,1202 Wooster Rd,66,Winona Lake,IN,46590,"Our goal is to establish a healing orchard and community space, working with local organizations through open communication. Utilizing local resources such as the Allen County Soil and Water Conservation District, we aim to provide ongoing opportunities for healing, community involvement, and education. We will also be requesting in kind sponsorship and donations as an option to add a few more trees, one at each location. The intent is to encourage other organizations to use the space as an educational opportunity for their programs as well. We are excited to have the support and permission from the City Parks and Recreation department to include Gren Park as a location for this project.

Our project is designed to impact urban forestry, soil health and increase workforce development through continued collaboration with local organizations. We will leverage resources available within the city and involve the Save Maumee organization to bring in volunteers, educational partners, and workshop participants alongside the maintenance and care from the youth program. The intent for the youth stipend is to provide paid training to 10 students per year where they will learn how to properly care for and maintain an urban orchard with naive pollinators and natural methods. Each student will be paid $20 per hour up to 20 hours per year to assist with the workload and maintenance of the orchards. We are hoping this project inspires students to consider careers in forestry and other conservation positions.

The stipend may also provide an opportunity for the unhoused population to participate. There will be no more than 10 participants per year, whether youth or marginalized population, as that is all the budget allows. Outreach efforts will be exhausted by Sheathed, Inc to gain interest and promote workforce development amongst youth and/or unhoused participants. Further, Sheathed, Inc. will provide transportation as needed. ","Our goal to create a healing orchard, community space and educational location in collaboration with local organizations will be accomplished by maintaining consistent and open lines of communication with everyone involved. By utilizing local resources like Allen County Soil and Water Conservation District and other organizations we will be able to plan and provide a continued outlet for healing, community involvement and education for the community.

Planting Plan:

To ensure the success of this orchard we will consult with local orchard professionals and follow along with the guidelines of the US Forest Service’s Tree Owner Manual. The manual has instructions for site preparation, watering, mulching and fertilizing.  The specific recommendation we want to adhere to is watering. As the manual states: “First 3 years after planting: If the soil is dry, provide about 1-1/2 gallons of water per diameter inch of the trunk.” While collecting rainwater will be the main method for watering, we do have a plan to have water delivered to storage containers in case of dry summers. The rest of the plan will include the following:

Year 1 (beginning in the Fall):
Watering: Each prepared hole will be filled with water prior to trees going in the ground. Water will be provided for each tree daily for the first two weeks and weekly after that until winter. By planting in the Fall, we conserve watering and increase the success of the sapling taking root.
Mulching: a combination of native plants, cover crop, leaves and mulch will be used around the base of the trees to provide a great layer of soil cover that includes habitat for pollinators.
Education: Along with the education provided for trauma and addiction healing, training sessions will be conducted for youth, volunteers, and other groups on proper watering. monitoring and mulching techniques.
Responsibility: Jesus Rosario from Innervestment and Rose River Farms will oversee the project, maintenance efforts and training of youth with the help of other volunteers.
Year 2:
Watering: Trees will be watered weekly or bi-weekly during the spring and summer months, adjusting based on weather conditions to ensure adequate moisture levels.
Mulching: The green and brown mulch will be monitored, and the natural cycle of native perennials will begin to creep into the area. This will ensure retention of moisture and temperature changes.
Pruning: If needed, light pruning will be conducted to remove any dead or damaged branches, promoting healthy growth.
Education: Continued education sessions will be provided to reinforce maintenance practices among youth students, community members and other participants.
Responsibility: The youth student group will begin to take form, train and care for the orchard with supervision from the project leader.
Year 3:
Watering: By the third Fall these trees should be well established. Monitoring of weather and soil conditions will dictate the need for additional monthly watering. 
Mulching: The natural green mulch should begin to fill out underneath the tree canopy and the wood mulch should be prominently shaped (like a ring not a volcano) around the base.
Pruning: Biannual to annual pruning will be performed in the winters following year 3. This will occur in February to remove any problematic branches, support fruiting and long-term health.
Monitoring: Regular health assessments and application of natural fungicide and pesticides will be conducted (if needed) throughout the growing periods after planting. This is in order to identify any issues early and address them promptly without major damage to the trees.
Responsibility: The youth group (10 students) will have a good working and maintenance schedule and would have had the proper training to ensure proper care during the years of the grant and well beyond!

Beyond the duration of this grant private landowners have agreed to be responsible for maintaining and caring for the trees. The orchard at Gren Park will become more of a community garden space for the residents of that neighborhood with support and management from the neighborhood association. It is the hope that organizations will communicate interest in using the space for further educational opportunities.","['peach', 'pear']","{'Red Apple': 6, 'Peach': 6, 'Pear': 26, 'Cherry': 26, 'Unspecified': 10}","['Improve mental health through tree planting', 'Promote mindfulness with tree planting activities', 'Provide physical exercise through tree planting', 'Increase serotonin levels with soil microbes during tree planting', 'Foster social connections and combat loneliness through community tree planting events', 'Educate community on mental health benefits, sustainability practices, and ecological benefits of tree planting', 'Support urban neighborhoods, youth, underserved populations, unhoused persons, and the environment', 'Engage in outreach efforts with the unhoused population for mental health support', 'Develop workforce through partnerships and a youth training program', 'Create green spaces, community gardens, and urban food forests', 'Raise awareness on native species, invasive species, and benefits of pollinator plots.']"
Pentecostal Church of Holiness,6.0,"The PCH Veterans Memorial Peace Garden Fruit and Nut Tree Planting Project is a community-focused initiative to beautify the west side of the church with six carefully selected trees: apple, peach, pear, and pecan. These trees were chosen for their suitability to the region, ecological benefits, and capacity to provide fresh produce for the community. The apple tree will offer crisp, sweet fruits, while the peach tree will yield juicy, flavorful peaches; both are excellent for fresh consumption and baking. The pear tree, particularly varieties like 'Bartlett' and 'D’Anjou,' will produce sweet, succulent fruits within a few years, complementing the pecan tree, which will provide buttery, nutrient-rich nuts after six to ten years. Each tree adds aesthetic value to the garden, supports local biodiversity, and encourages environmental stewardship.

To ensure the trees thrive long-term, the project incorporates robust maintenance strategies and community involvement. Proper planting techniques, including soil preparation and mulching, will establish a strong foundation, while an irrigation system will provide consistent moisture during critical early years. Annual pruning and pest management will promote healthy growth and resilience. Youth volunteers and community members will play an active role, participating in tree care activities, monitoring tree health, and attending educational workshops. Protective measures such as tree guards and environmentally friendly pest control will safeguard the trees from damage. A dedicated maintenance fund and partnerships with local arborists will ensure ongoing care, while digital tools and health logs will track progress. Together, these efforts will create a sustainable, thriving green space that serves as a living memorial, a source of fresh produce, and a model for community-driven urban forestry.","The Veterans Memorial Peace Garden and Tree Walk in North Lawndale will benefit veterans, residents, and youth by providing a tranquil space for reflection, recreation, and education. Veterans will be honored through memorials, while residents will gain access to improved green spaces that enhance mental and physical well-being.

However, with additional funding opportunities, we foresee incorporating initiatives that could significantly contribute to urban and community forestry workforce development.

Potential initiatives include:

1. Training and Skill Development:
   With sufficient resources, the project could offer hands-on training in tree planting, maintenance, pruning, and pest management. These sessions would provide community members, particularly youth, with valuable skills that could lead to career opportunities in landscaping, horticulture, and urban forestry.

2. Partnerships with Local Organizations:
   Additional funding could enable partnerships with environmental nonprofits, urban forestry programs, and educational institutions to deliver workshops and collaborative learning experiences. These partnerships would expose participants to broader professional networks and resources, fostering pathways into green industry careers.

3. Engagement of Local Workforce:
   With increased funding, the project could prioritize hiring local contractors and businesses specializing in landscaping and green infrastructure. This approach would not only support the local economy but also provide workers with exposure to sustainable practices and urban forestry techniques.

4. Educational Programming:
   Expanded funding would allow the development of educational programs through the Tree Walk, offering workshops and resources to introduce residents and students to careers in urban forestry and environmental stewardship. 

5. Ongoing Maintenance and Stewardship:
   Additional resources would support a long-term stewardship program where community members can engage in tree health monitoring, garden maintenance, and ecological restoration. These activities could serve as a stepping stone for further training and workforce readiness.

While these initiatives are not currently part of the project, they represent the potential for future workforce development with the proper funding and support, making the Veterans Memorial Peace Garden and Tree Walk an even greater asset to the North Lawndale community.","Detailed Planting and Maintenance Plan (3 Years)

We have seven church partners who will each provide five volunteers to help with tree planting and ongoing care and watering. In addition, we will employ youth from the community to help water and care for the trees.","The United Methodist Church has 298 churches in the Northern IL Conference with 66,737 members. Through our connection, we have the opportunity and blessing to work toward acts of mercy and piety by addressing food insecurity and environmental disparities in a meaningful way. We believe that we can do this by developing a collaborative partnership of churches and community organizations to support the fruitful work being done to address the lack of adequate tree cover on the west and south sides of Chicago. We will partner with the Net-Zero, Garrett Evangelical Seminary Center for Ecological Regeneration, and the Austin Garden Collective to work together to study environmental injustice and its impacts in the community wher we will be planting. In addition, we will develop relationships and train up to 25 high school students to help plant and take care of the 20 trees we will plant in the community. We will develop a three-five year plan to care for the new trees through church and community volunteers as well as paid youth workers.

During the non-growing season, we will focus on knowledge and relationship building and project planning with five non-profit organizations/churches in our partner communities and have six meetings by April 2025. We will develop a group of 15-25 high school students in the partner community by working with the high schools, community organizations, and churches so that we have 15-25 engaged students willing to care for the trees by April 1, 2025.

The volunteers from NIC churches and organization partners will benefit from building relationships with our partner community members. The high school students trained to care for the trees will gain knowledge, build relationships, and receive a small stipend. The community members will benefit from cleaner air, cooler temperatures, and enhanced beauty and shade provided by the tree canopy in their neighborhood. The trees filter pollutants from stormwater and reduce the amount of runoff that reaches waterways and help mitigate the urban heat island effect by releasing water vapor into the atmosphere and intercepting sunlight. In addition, trees provide shade, which can help reduce energy costs associated with cooling. By planting native trees, we aim to improve air quality, provide shade, and create a habitat for local wildlife.

This project will include a potential partnership with Nature Sacred, a group that works to connect people with nature. The project is designed with community input to be responsive to their desires and needs. In engaging community members throughout the past few years of space activation, project partners worked collaboratively to develop a placemaking report, summarizing the goals shared by residents and stakeholders. This placemaking report outlines baseline gathered throughout two years, and includes residents’ vision for the space’s transformation: A place for children to run, play, and participate in sports, For the space to stay green so that there may be fresh air in an otherwise dense and urbanized neighborhood,  and The incorporation of natural elements such as flowers, trees, a walkable pathway and seating. A place for the community to gather for cultural music, fun, food distribution, and family-friendly programming.  Since the 2023 Plazita Verde Placemaking Report, there has been work done to activate the space including installing the following bus stop seating, planters with native perennial plantings, marimba and drum set, a new parklet with seating, tables, a stage, a bike rack designed and built by MCC’s YouthBuild team. With the support of the Tree Canopy & Workforce Community Grant, the DEHCW and other project partners will be able to increase tree canopy in the space and engage community members in further activation of the space. Members of the community will be part of the team charged with planting and maintaining the trees, furthering the sense of community and ownership of the space. This group could include members from SSCHC’s LPLS who have interest in tree-planting programs in the community.  The group will plant up to 20 native trees that will be selected from the list of allowable trees from Johnson’s Nursery.","The goals of this project are to increase community resilience, improve access to high quality greenspace, and empower the community by working alongside residents to transform the natural and built conditions where they live, learn, work and play. This project will increase community access to high quality greenspace in an area where there is a disproportionately low number of options, foster community connection and cohesion with each other and pride in the neighborhood, and encourage leadership and agency among Muskego Way neighbors. Environmental injustice contributes to health disparities across populations of different ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic backgrounds1, and marginalized communities are disproportionately at a higher risk of exposure to lead, air pollution, hazardous waste, and extreme heat2. Most of SSCHC’s patient population lives within USEPA’s Justice 40 tracts listed as “Disadvantaged”3, and within the Kinnickinnic River Watershed, which is 97% developed, with few quality, accessible green spaces. The marginalized community SSCHC serves is burdened with social inequities, and therefore feels the impacts of these environmental injustices where they live, work, learn and play, leading to health inequities, because environmental factors can lead to health disparities4. Sixteenth Street’s DEHCW was founded on the principles of environmental justice. From our first focus on cleaning up a neighborhood brownfield to creating our Asthma Department to helping empower community members to make their neighborhoods safer, greener and healthier places to live, we have evolved over the years to meet the needs of Milwaukee’s near south side residents. Today, our diverse programming keeps our core mission alive – improving access, building resilience, and empowering residents by meeting people where they’re at to create resident-directed impact in the built and natural environment where our patients live, work, learn and play. The project will also provide community members directly impacted by the urban heat island effect mentioned above with education on tree planting and maintenance that they can use to plant trees in their own yards or for other community projects, empowering them to help increase shade, stormwater retention and biodiversity This, in turn, will lead to better health outcomes and a community that is more resilient to the effects of climate change. Community members will also be engaged to give input on the design of the space to make sure that it meets their needs and will be a beautiful space that they will want to use moving forward. Engaging the community in this way will help them feel a sense of ownership over the project and the space and the hope is that they will engage other community members in activating the space.   1 National Library of Medicine, https://www.ncbi.nml.hih.gov Environmental Justice and Health of Children 2 American Public Health Association, https://www.apha.org, Environmental Health>Environmental Justice 3 US EPA Justice40 by Number of Categories Map November 2022.

We will purchase the trees from them and will ask them to be a resource for our team in proper tree planting and maintenance. Our Neighborhood Revitalization Project Manager, who will be managing the program, and our LPLS Green Team will also help to train community volunteers and project partners in proper planting and maintenance. They have been trained by Johnson’s staff and are currently undertaking a residential tree planting project in which they are engaging and educating community members on how to plant and maintain native trees in their yards. 

 

The project team and volunteers will plant and mulch the trees, per their training and the US Forest Service’s Tree Owner Manual and will monitor when additional mulching must be done. The team will install 1-2 rain barrels to supply water for the trees and will put a weekly watering schedule in place. If the rain barrels prove to not be sufficient sources of water, the team will engage neighbors adjacent to the lot to assess if they would be willing to let the team utilize their water to supplement the water collected in the rain barrels. The team will also utilize gator bags as needed to assist with the watering of the trees. An additional alternative would be engaging a contractor to water the trees weekly if the other two methods are not sufficient. The volunteers and staff identified to plant and water the trees will also assess other maintenance that needs to be done when they visit the site weekly and will plan periodic maintenance days as needed.

Landmark Columbus Foundation,30.0,"This project involves planting 30 native trees, including Celtis occidentalis-Hackberry, Gymnocladus dioicus-Kentucky Coffee Tree, Liriodendron tulipifera-Tulip Poplar, Platanus occidentalis-Sycamore, and Quercus shumardii within the Downtown Entrance Plaza. In partnership with the Columbus Redevelopment Commission, the POW/MIA group, and other critical stakeholders, Landmark Columbus Foundation (LCF) has been leading an effort to revitalize this plaza. The team hired Merritt Chase Landscape Architects to create a phased masterplan. Some funds exist within the city to assist with the installation; however, they fall short of those necessary to include one of the most important elements: trees. 

This 1.5 acre space–previously called the POW/MIA, Law Enforcement, and Garton Plaza–was established as a way to honor and remember the many that have served the country. Though it is currently overgrown and underutilized, the plaza includes important community memorials. It is no longer a place to reflect, honor, and celebrate, making it in need of attention. In addition, it serves as an important entryway into Downtown Columbus, presenting an opportunity to integrate this area into other current or future developments, such as a growing trail system and riverfront development. 

As described by the Arbor Day Foundation, “trees play a critical role in creating healthier, safer, and more connected communities. They clean our air, filter our water, and even slow storm surge and flooding in our cities. Trees also provide shade and cool our cities by up to 10 degrees, which can help prevent heat-related deaths in urban areas."" Trees play a critical role in meeting the overall project goals, which are to transform the landscape into a more desirable space, collaborate with local partners and adjacent projects, improve key design features and connectivity, and ensure the project’s integrity and universal accessibility.","The trees are a key component of the vision to redesign the Downtown Entrance Plaza into a space that encourages reflection, contemplation, and joy. The memorial for the POW/MIA Soldiers is a core element of the project and the new design will pay homage to the statement written on the flag: “You are not forgotten”. As the trees grow and change with each season, the space becomes a community gathering place right in the heart of downtown.

The trees will define the spaces ensuring students from the nearby IU Architecture School have a shady place to sketch and eat lunch, while the residents of the surrounding neighborhood have a place to spend quality time with their pets and family. The trees will assist with cooling and stormwater retention, while also attracting birds and wildlife to watch as a user takes a break after walking or biking on the nearby trail. 

In addition, the project allows the community the opportunity to educate and celebrate trees, acting as an example of how to properly plant, maintain, and educate about the many benefits they offer.",200 Jackson Street,,Columbus,Indiana,47201,408 6th Street, ,Columbus,IN,47201,"There has been recent momentum in the City of Columbus related to trees, and this project will help bring awareness and encourage continuous improvement within the community related to forestry professions and the need for this expertise. The city recently contracted the services of the Davey Resource Group to perform a partial tree inventory for trees in the right-of-way (commonly referred to as street trees) for the area known as the “Big Block” generally considered from 25th Street south to 2nd Street and from Jackson Street east to Central Avenue, which includes the site of the Downtown Entrance Plaza. The data collection included, location, tree species, size, and condition.  With that data, Davey Resource Group was also contracted to provide an analysis of those trees and to create an Urban Forest Management Plan for public street trees.

This management plan is intended to help develop a prioritized maintenance and proactive inspection and pruning cycles based on the inventory data to improve tree health. Other elements of a street tree management plan include developing a tree planting program to mitigate necessary removals, increase canopy cover, develop a public outreach program to understand the benefits of urban trees, and explore the many ways the community can help support the city’s overall urban tree canopy. The Downtown Entrance Plaza planting project would become one of the first projects to utilize this new data and management approach.

The Downtown Entrance Plaza tree planting offers the opportunity to put this data and learning to use and, in turn, grow the focus and attention on trees and the health of the urban forest. It will also help bring attention to the need for more tree experts in the community and working for the city.","The team will carry out the goals of the project by establishing strong community partnerships, seeking guidance from high quality professionals, and leveraging key relationships to enhance community awareness, involvement, and education.  

In addition to ensuring a proper tree planting technique, the team understands that it is critical to implement a comprehensive planting and maintenance plan to ensure the health and long-term survival of the trees. The US Forest Service’s Tree Manual and the Columbus Urban Forest Management Plan were used to create the plan.

Gary Food Council,5.0,"This project will create a biodiverse community food forest that will support local food security, protect wildlife, create economic opportunity and last many generations. The project is designed to benefit community members through cultural and environmental education, employment opportunities, nourishment, and the expansion of green space. 
The project will create a vibrant space in the center of the city that inspires others to do the same throughout the city, creating a network of resilient food gardens and forests. We have previously given away native fruit and nut trees to others with similar missions and maintain a tool library for local farmers. This grant will allow us to build upon this existing effort and allow it to become regenerative by bringing young people in in a meaningful way. 
Another important goal of the project is to preserve and present the history of Midtown, which holds many powerful examples of African American Cooperatives, service organizations, community gardens, and cultural icons that we can learn from to address the challenges we face today.  
We will purchase 5 fruit trees, 1 apple, 2 peach and 2 cherry trees and maintaining and inspecting the fruit and nut trees that were previously planted on site.  The project will employ student interns and residents of Brother's Keeper homeless shelter to learn more how to care and properly maintain new trees.  There will be an annual event to showcase the milestones and success of the project.  Ongoing community events take place at the community garden and food forest and will serve as a catalyst to inform the community and allow opportunities for volunteerism.  ","The project will benefit student interns, residents of Brother's Keeper Homeless Shelter, residents of Gary, IN and the greater Lake County community. The Gary Food Council students will receive a deeper understanding of tree care and maintenance with hands on experience and workforce opportunities. Students reconnect with the earth and ground to the community. Their positive experience contributes to an increased desire to remain in the city and be proactive within the community. The residents of Brother's Keeper continuously request opportunities to be employed at the community garden and food forest. This grant will give opportunities to employ men who are reentering society and the workforce. Residents also comment that the trees bring them shade in the summertime and opportunities to feel emotional wellbeing and a since of calm. The residents of Gary learn about the trees, tree care and reducing the local heat map when they visit the community garden and food forest. Increased educational opportunities will support our community being informed about decisions that support or harm the local environment. This project supports environmental justice with the increased access to locally grown food, heat reduction with the tree canopy, and environmental educational for the community and youth. The project supports workforce development with direct opportunities to youth who have been learning about sustainable practices and have the potential to study subjects related to environmentalism, green infrastructures and sustainable practices as they matriculate to university. Every year we have students who show increased interest in green urbanism. We take every opportunity to hire men from Brother's keeper who have reentered society and want to stabilize their life. Additional benefits include increased opportunity for residents to gather outside and experience the benefits of green spaces. We hope to reduce social anxiety in our community with programming connected to this initiative and support community participants learning about recapturing our food supply with personal fruit trees on home lawns. 
We will measure our success based on the number of people who have been reached in this program. The number of students with increased knowledge about tree care and support, the amount of visitors to the site and the controllable health of the purchased and maintained trees.

"Wesley United Methodist Church, Charleston IL",12.0,"We propose to plant 12 native trees in and near the Wesley Community Gardens to create a meditative orchard. Selected species include dogwood, hornbeam, apple, peach, and pear in a total area covering approximately 1500? square feet. We seek a grant of $21,560.00 to procure trees and planting materials and tools, and to pay for ongoing maintenance, educational experiences, and community engagement events. 

Our Community Shade and Fruit Tree project will entail the planting and care for 12 native trees, including dogwood or oak, hornbeam, apple, peach, and pear, in and near our church’s community gardens’ space. Currently, Wesley has three garden spaces: a raised bed garden where community members adopt beds for themselves and the community, an in-ground garden focused explicitly on donations to the area food panties to help address food insecurity, and a pollinator garden where native flowers help foster pollinators needed to maximize vegetable growth.

The project will create a meditative orchard where students and church and community members can both gather and relax AND harvest fruit for themselves and area food pantries, once the trees have matured. The project will initially entail tree procurement and site preparation, planting, ongoing maintenance, and produce harvesting. 

The project will also include educational workshops led by Tree Commission leaders, Master Gardeners and Master Naturalists, and Green Team and Scout-facilitated community events offering opportunities to engage with God’s Creation and enjoy the fruits and benefits of native trees, from cooling shade to actual produce. For example, the project will support an annual harvest event showcasing the meditative orchard and the adjoining community gardens and offering multiple ways to be good stewards of God’s creation and learn various native tree related workforce skills.","The vision for our project is to create a meditative shade and fruit tree Meditative Orchard area that will help fulfill the following goals: curbing food insecurity for students and community members, offering opportunities to enact stewardship with God’s Creation, learning workforce skills, and enhances connections with and appreciation for the natural world. By planting native shade and fruit trees, we thus aim to provide shade, improve air quality, create habitat for local wildlife, and produce fruit for community members and donations to local food pantries. 

Because Wesley UMC and its gardens adjoin our local regional university, Eastern Illinois University and the Wesley Foundation and serve the wider community and county, the project will benefit multiple communities. The project will offer each of these communities a meditative space to relax, reflect, connect, and learn through events, educational workshops, and opportunities for stewardship. It will also provide fresh produce to augment donations from our established vegetable garden to area food pantries at EIU and the wider Charleston community, as well as church community members in need. 

As a meditative orchard, the project will also proffer tangible food environmental justice benefits once fruit is harvested and shared with communities and food pantries, helping to address the real need in Coles County, Illinois where food insecurity is on the rise. An analysis conducted by Eastern Illinois University professor Michael Gillespie showed that “14.5 percent of families in the county live in poverty, a jump from 13.9 percent in 2016…. According to the data, 30 percent of families in the county are food insecure or lacking reliable access to a sufficient quantity of affordable and/or nutritious food.” The study also reveals an even greater need among families with children: 46.5 percent. According to the Journal Gazette Times Courier, “In the Mattoon school district, 57.6 percent of the entire student population is eligible for free or reduced lunch. For Charleston, that number is at 47.8 percent.” 

Food insecurity also impacts approximately 40% of students at Eastern Illinois University and Lake Land College, according to Gillespie. Ultimately, we hope to help address food insecurity and promote long-term care and sustainability of the meditative orchard and a drive for stewardship in and outside the workforce.

To support workforce development, we will engage with arborists, Master Gardeners and Naturalists, and Charleston Tree Commission members as mentors for the communities involved in our project, including Green Team members, Scouts, students from middle and high school through college, and interested community members.

Jacksonville Park Foundation,200.0,"We are living in an age of climate crisis, facing a real and unchartered threat to our food security, biodiversity and social cohesion. In this context, the role of agroecology has become more pertinent than ever.  Agroecology, especially in urban areas, is a tangible way to help people find positive and practical solutions to complex social and environmental challenges.  One solution is to increase the number of better-maintained vacant lots turned into more accessible fresh produce, or as we call them aGROWhoods.  Moreover, agroecology practiced on blighted vacant lots can create new or restored habitats for biodiversity, increased plant/tree coverage and public spaces that local people take pride in, unite in and utilize to improve their wellbeing. Our work is proof that community-based agroecology brings people together in an age of increasing social isolation and community breakdown.

The latest aGROWhoods will seek to turn vacant lots into vibrant orchards.  These Orchards of Grace are devoted to growing fruit for the community and increasing our community’s tree-scape. This new community/faith-based partnership will be planned, planted and maintained by volunteers from the participating partners, and the harvest will be available to the community, especially in environmental justice neighborhoods of Jacksonville and provide vital fruit/produce as part of the community based kitchen incubator project.

Each Orchard of Grace will be planted in collaboration with the Jacksonville Park Foundation, First Presbyterian Church and the City of Jacksonville.  The JPF aGROWhood team will provide the daily leadership of the project, the City of Jacksonville will partner to coordinate land acquisition, and First Presbyterian will provide volunteer engagement and community support. Notably, the aGROWhood team will provide the orchard design, coordination of plant materials, help with event organizing, and training in orchard care. The aGROWhood team will be responsible for all ongoing care of the orchard as well as distribution of the harvest.  The Presbyterian congregation will provide volunteers as needed and overall support of the project.

The Orchard of Grace will be established on vacant lots across the Jacksonville Environmental Justice neighborhoods. The goal is to establish four orchards. We will plant over 200 fruit trees.  These will include Apple, Pear, Cherry, Peach, Plum, and Pawpaw varieties.

An AmeriCorps VISTA member will support the project.","The Orchards of Grace Initiative seeks to provide significant benefits beyond helping communities meet their nutritional needs. This hands-on community-based orchard initiative focuses on sustainable and regenerative food production. This means teaching want-a-be producers the foundational principles of agroecology. Notably, how to grow food using natural approaches that help protect the environment, including improvements in water, soil, and air quality; protect ecosystems and wildlife; and reduce greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change.

Most of all, the Orchard of Grace as a partnering project within the Mainstreet Farms initiative can help create economic revitalization across Jacksonville environmental justice neighborhoods, provide valuable vocational skills, help improve community appearance and livability, and reduce food costs. 

Funding from this request, will be split equally between 1) roughly half of funding for orchard development that will establish four orchards with over 200 fruit trees; and 2) the remaining half of funds for a green economy and green workforce training initiative designed to advance our local foods workforce development program using the successful Roots of Success: Environmental Literacy and Job Training Program. These equal investments will aid in fighting food insecurity, climate change and poverty concurrently. 

The Orchard of Grace initiative will offer the following benefits: 


 * Environmental benefits: Improve the environment by increasing tree cover and providing green spaces.
 * Food security: Provide a sustainable food source for local communities.
 * Health benefits: Improve human wellbeing by inviting nature into urban environments. Some studies have shown that closeness to natural environments can reduce stress and promote peace.
 * Learning opportunities: Provide a space to learn about nature and traditional skills like pruning, grafting, and thinning.
 * Gathering space: Provide a focal point for people to gather and work together.
 * Community connection: Help people connect with their local community by providing opportunities to meet new people and get outdoors.
 * Traditional skills: Provide a platform for passing down traditional skills from generation to generation.
 * Wildlife habitat: Provide food and nectar for wildlife and pollinators throughout the year.
 * Heritage varieties: Provide access to native heritage varieties of fruit that are not commonly found in supermarkets.
Ultimately, the Orchard of Grace will be more than a collection of fruit trees in a public space, planted with the goal of providing the community with fresh, locally-grown organic fruit, it will: 


 * Encourage residents to live more sustainably and to grow their own food;
 * Educate the community about how fruit grows;
 * Bring fresh fruit to low-income communities;
 * Grow food for food banks;
 * Provide produce for a community supported kitchen incubator;
 * Build community within a neighborhood;
 * Animate green spaces by providing activities for children and adults; and
 * Create employment training opportunities for young people who want to work in urban agriculture.
By working with nature, and not against her, we can create healthy, diverse and resilient systems, while reducing our impact on climate change and environmental degradation. The Orchard of Grace aGROWhoods will provide vital green spaces in our community, where people will be encouraged to interact with nature either through becoming custodians of trees or by simply being around them and enjoying their shade, beauty and fruit. 

Some areas of our community—namely the Justice 40 neighborhoods where our four Orchards of Grace will be established—have become ‘no grow zones’ or ‘food deserts’: where fresh, quality fruit and vegetables are hard to find. Sedate lifestyles and poor diets have led to rising rates of diabetes and obesity. Fresh, nutritious fruit and the activity involved in growing and harvesting has to be part of the solution. Moreover, these same neighborhoods are some of the communities areas that have the least treescape or have an aging or damaged treescape from prior storms or poor care.

We truly believe that the Orchard of Grace and edible landscapes initiative will offer a space to learn from each other and nature, and a place in which training of traditional skills can occur, such as pruning and grafting. And a place for celebration of diversity, nourishing fruit and the trees that provide it. Arguably, community orchards have never been more important. They provide the setting for encounters between neighbors and the natural environment. They are where young and old, rich and poor of all backgrounds can roll up their sleeves and work together or put their hair down and enjoy the harvest.",225 South Clay Avenue,,Jacksonville,Illinois,62650,225 South Clay Avenue, ,Jacksonville,IL,62650,"Fifty percent of the funding from this proposal will aid in advancing the Mainstreet Farms Pay Dirt Farm School, an educational/workforce development that offers an urban farm apprenticeships.  Moved by our collective enthusiasm for all things fresh and local, the partnership is taking “Growing the Neighborhood” to an entirely new level and producing affordable healthy food and flowers for our community.  Through the Jacksonville Park Foundation, a 501c3 non-profit organization, we are re-vitalizing vacant lots across the city and converting them into urban farms positioned to serving community members with their very own farm(hood).

The mission of the program is to advance sustainable food production for individuals wishing to grow local food and bloom sustainable pollinator plants that beautify a community.  The Pay Dirt Farm school has been founded with the belief that an urban farming system is more sustainable—environmentally, economically, and socially, while also playing a vital role in the development of citizens whose views and visions create positive change, one lot at a time.

Our urban farm setting with street views provides an ideal environment for developing an urban farming lifestyle in touch with the land. The lessons learned will last a lifetime, while building a resilient and food secure community.

The curriculum is based on the following:

• Center for Agroecology & Sustainable Food Systems at UC Santa Cruz (Teaching Organic Farming and Gardening, and Teaching Direct Marketing & Small Farm Viability)
• The Market Gardener by Jean-Martin Fourtier
• Growing for Market continuous feedback, adherence to strict food and human safety precautions, and meticulous record keeping.

In addition to the core curriculum, Apprentices also use the Roots of Success Environmental Literacy program. This course is particularly useful for training young people and adults who need additional information and work-readiness skills. Developed by Dr. Raquel Pinderhughes (San Francisco State University) for people coming out of incarceration and unemployment, the award-winning curriculum engages students by making learning relevant, building on prior knowledge and experience, and connecting education to employment and further learning in green career fields.

After three months of classroom and growing instruction, apprentices are assigned to a 33-week paid work experience, starting the second week of March at one of aGROWhood sites where they get relevant experience and close supervision.  Apprentices are paid hourly for 15 to 30 hours per week and get regular check-ins from Pay Dirt Farm School team members. Monday’s are a non-paid 6-hour class focused on professional development, field trips, and climate-smart agricultural practices. The paid work experience is a critical part of the program model and allows the Pay Dirt Farm School to develop and strengthen working relationships with many local commercial and nonprofit operations.

To ensure that apprentices fully experience all aspects of running an urban farm, all responsibilities of our farming operation will be rotated, such as management of the propagation high tunnel, irrigation, and field preparation; leading planting, harvest, wash and pack; supervising short-season interns; staffing CSA pickup and writing newsletters; driving the farm equipment; and, toward the end of the apprenticeship, a two-week rotation leading the entire crew in all field work.

With lofty production goals, and limited land we will teach apprentices many practices that allow for maximized profits while maintaining sustainability and environmental responsibility.  We want the apprenticeship to be a learning tool for all who are willing and interested. We intend to demonstrate that urban farming—one lot at a time—can be not just a token of interest, but a viable way to make a living on a small piece of land.

We will employ and demonstrate techniques that allow our soil to remain in place, while improving fertility. We believe that our constant neighborly presence has great potential for building relationships, community, and accountability, among neighbors. The project will be measured against the following outcomes:

1. Develop the skills of beginning farmers through formal training and apprenticeship in sustainable urban agriculture. 10 apprentices will be engaged.
2. Assist beginning urban farmers to overcome barriers, including access to land, capital, credit, and markets. 10 farmers will establish new businesses.
3. Support the expansion of urban agriculture activities in Jacksonville, creating mentored jobs for beginning urban farmers, while supplying fresh produce to food insecure communities. During the two-year period, the project will create five new food, flower farms and orchards.","• Plans for planting and mulching of the trees: All trees will be planted and initially mulched by volunteers organized by project partners.  The aGROWhood team will coordinate the overall project, and volunteers will be coordinated with all partners and community members.

• Plans for watering: The aGROWhood team and farm apprentices will coordinate the watering of all trees.  The City of Jacksonville will provide the water.  A 500-gallon tank on a truck will be used to get water too trees on a weekly basis.  Irrigations systems will be added during the second year of the project.

• Plans for education for those responsible for maintenance. The aGROWhood Workforce development program and the Roots of success curriculum will be used to educate all members of the team.  An AmeriCorps VISTA member with the Jacksonville Park Foundation will coordinate the overall training program and volunteer needs. 

• Description of who will be responsible for maintaining the health of the trees long term. The aGROWhood Team will ensure that all maintenance of the orchards over the course of the project.

"Metcalfe Park Community Bridges, Inc.",8.0,"In January 2022, a mother was murdered by her estranged husband who also shot his14 year old daughter at their home on N. 36th  Street. Neighbors witnessed this horrific crime and were traumatized. They wanted a  park with design elements such as  a welcome gate, ADA accessibility. benches to accommodate groups like the  Metcalfe Park Moms and to facilitate  community building programs .Residents want 8 peach trees, native  grasses and perennials. Water is not accessible, and residents would like to use drought resistant, non-invasive plants and trees and install shed-like structure and rain barrels for water collection and storing garden equipment that needs to be acquired for maintaining the park.  
In summer 2022, Metcalfe Park Community Bridges (MPCB) was awarded a $10,000 Healing Space grant from the city of Milwaukee to start North Star Park in a city owned vacant lots, located directly across from the crime scene. This grant was allocated to Groundworks Milwaukee for preliminary grading and an ADA access  In order to fully develop the park. MPCB negotiated the purchase of this lot from the city in August 2023.  MPCB installed a fence along the alley on the west side of the park to deter illegal dumping. Residents want to paint and decorate this fence.  In summer of 2024, MPCB received a grant for in-kind landscape design and planning services valued at $40,000 from the non-profit Nature Sacred, plus a bench and a $10,000 award for construction costs. In addition, MPCB received an $8000 grant from the Milwaukee Archdiocese for park construction and the Milwaukee Department of Public works  has agreed to donate pavers. MPCB seeks to raise an additional $30,000 to  cover the costs of trees, mulch, garden equipment, programming, and stipends for its Green Team members who will be providing maintenance for this project.  MPCB anticipates that North Star Park will: 1) Up to 50 residents will be involved.

Where: The Interfaith Peace Canopy will be located at the Haughville Seventh-day Adventist Church at 2716 W 20th St., Indianapolis, IN 46222. The church is located just 4 miles from the heart of downtown Indianapolis. The trees will be planted in the southeast corner of the property that is separated from non-church property by a fence. This section of the approved parcel of land is approximately 0.5 acres. This location was strategically selected due to its high crime rate, with a CAP Index Crime Score of 7 out of 10, compared to the national average of 4. Violent crimes such as homicide and assault are rated particularly high at 8 and 9. The area also faces significant health and socioeconomic challenges, with high asthma rates, a lack of indoor plumbing, and a high percentage of residents living at or below twice the federal poverty level. Environmental concerns are also prominent, with high legacy pollution indicators. Additionally, there is a notable need for workforce development, as 16% of adults over 25 lack a high school diploma.

This plan integrates best practices from the US Forest Service's Tree Owner Manual, volunteer engagement, and professional arborist support.

Planting Plan
Tree Selection and Preparation

Species: 10 native shade trees (e.g., Northern Red Oak, Tulip, Sweet Gum) and 10 fruit-bearing trees (e.g., apple, pear, cherry).
Location: Trees will be strategically planted around IMCA and MTI School, focusing on open gathering areas, playgrounds, and walking paths to maximize shade and community benefit.
Site Preparation: Soil testing and amendments (if necessary) will be conducted to ensure optimal growing conditions. Planting sites will be cleared of weeds and debris, and the ground will be prepped with nutrient-rich topsoil.
Planting Process

Digging the Hole: Holes will be dug two to three times wider than the root ball but no deeper than its height, preventing settling and ensuring root stability.
Tree Placement: Trees will be placed upright, with the root flare visible above ground. Volunteers will backfill using a mix of existing soil and compost, tamping lightly to remove air pockets.
Staking: Trees will be staked as needed to support growth in windy conditions, with stakes removed after the first growing season.
Mulching: A 3-inch layer of organic mulch will be applied in a 3-foot radius around each tree, ensuring mulch does not touch the trunk to prevent rot.
Watering Plan
Watering is essential for tree survival, particularly in the first three years.

Weekly Watering Schedule

Amount: Each tree will receive 10 gallons of water per week during the growing season (spring through fall).
Method: Volunteers will use slow-drip irrigation bags, buckets with small drainage holes, or hoses to ensure deep root hydration without runoff.
Rainfall Adjustment: Watering will be reduced in weeks with sufficient rainfall (1 inch or more).
Year-by-Year Watering Breakdown

Year 1: Weekly watering to establish strong root systems.
Year 2: Bi-weekly watering as root systems expand and trees become more resilient.
Year 3: Monthly watering during dry spells to support continued growth and health.

We will also plant four American beech (Fagus grandifolia) near the sidewalk, two American hornbeam (Carpinus caroliniana) near the seminary Chapel to replace dying crabapples, and six fruit trees (two apple, two pear, two cherry) near the seminary dining hall to replace ornamental trees and provide fruit for the seminary community. 

Steve Thomas, a certified arborist who is an AMBS graduate, will provide training workshops on the planting and care of trees three times during each of three years (2025, 2026, 2027). The workshops will be available to AMBS students and employees, but targeted to students in the Elkhart Academy, a public high school for at-risk students. Paul Steury, the environmental science teacher at Elkhart Academy, will bring his class to AMBS for the workshops, introducing them to the work of urban forestry. 

Ongoing watering and care of the new trees will be done by students from AMBS who are employed to assist with maintenance tasks at the seminary. Many of these are international students whose visas only allow them to work on campus. These seminary students will also benefit from the tree-care workshops, potentially providing them skills they can continue to use after graduation.

AMBS will include the urban forestry project on its website's list of creation care initiatives (https://ambs.edu/creation-care-efforts-at-ambs/) and will share our story through a news release, invitations to the workshops, and Facebook updates.","Our goals include:
1. To increase tree canopy along Benham Avenue, a busy street in south Elkhart, Indiana. Many area residents walk across the AMBS campus along Benham Avenue to get from their residences (including a large apartment complex south of the seminary campus) to a shopping area just north of the seminary. In summer 2024, the city of Elkhart installed a new sidewalk along Benham Avenue. Planting more established trees along the sidewalk would provide shade to make the walk cooler, as well as providing beauty and other environmental benefits of trees. 

2. To increase the biodiversity of the tree canopy at AMBS. The current tree canopy on the AMBS property is heavy on maples and red oaks. Adding white oaks, beech, hornbeam, and fruit trees will provide greater biodiversity on our campus, as well as offering good shade and food for residents and wildlife.

3. To introduce at-risk students from The Elkhart Academy to urban forestry as a possible career.

Englewood Christian Church,50.0,"The proposed Englewood Urban Orchard is located on approximately one acre of cultivated urban farmland adjacent to PPHS-Englewood. We envision planting a mixed fruit and nut orchard with supportive plant species, or guilds, to create a healthy and sustainable ecosystem with the ultimate goal of harvesting the fruit for the school nutrition program and surrounding community.

We plan to plant an orchard of small fruit trees, several large fruit and nut trees, hedges of hazelnuts, and a natural fence of espaliered fruit trees (see Map, attached). Prior to planting, the soil needs to be tested and the lot cleared of invasive species and debris through the combined efforts of students, church and community volunteers, as well as professional contractors. Irrigation will be extended from the Englewood Urban Farm. This will inform any needed soil amendments and allow for ease in watering. 

PPHS-Englewood students will be central to the success, growth, and long-term sustainability of this project. Through a paid internship, PPHS-Englewood Agriculture students will learn valuable skills involved in urban farming, orchard management, and forestry. Interns will receive specialized training to equip them with the skills needed to maintain the campus orchard and contribute to valuable arboreal work throughout the community.

In addition, we plan to facilitate the distribution and planting of at least 50 trees throughout the Englewood and surrounding Near Eastside neighborhoods of Indianapolis. This will include trees on the Englewood Christian Church (57 N. Rural Street) campus, within Englewood’s existing Nature Playspace & Community Garden (14-26 N. Oxford Street) and on affordable housing developments owned by ECDC. The specific trees will be chosen by the residents themselves from the list of approved trees, and planted by students at PPHS-Englewood.","The Englewood Urban Orchard Project benefits not only students but also local communities, businesses, environmental groups, educators, and government entities by fostering a skilled workforce, enhancing the agricultural sector, and promoting sustainable farming. This initiative supports a sustainable economy and offers students valuable training and career opportunities.

The Project offers a sustainable solution for addressing food insecurity in Englewood, a neighborhood identified by the 2019 Marion County Community Health Assessment Report as needing improved food access. The USDA classifies Englewood as low-income with inadequate nutritious food access, and the CDC's Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) rates it as highly vulnerable (SVI 0.8852), highlighting significant social, economic, and health challenges.

Many Englewood neighborhood homes lack shade trees, creating a hot microclimate due to extensive sidewalks and asphalt. Distributing trees can lower energy costs, enhance air quality, and mitigate the heat island effect. Planting trees on church grounds and in the nearby nature park will provide crucial summer relief for many community members.

The hands-on training in orchard management offers PPHS students the opportunity to develop a diverse set of skills that will not only support their immediate career prospects but also build a foundation for lifelong learning and growth in the agricultural sector.

Cristo Rey St.Martin,16.0,"CRSM would like to plant a combination of site-appropriate native trees (oaks) and smaller trees that support wildlife. Because the site is sloped and near an existing parking lot and adjacent building,  we would need a selection of different trees for those conditions. We would choose a few salt-tolerant trees like Hackberry to plant near the parking lot. Along the lower slope of the hill and near a drainage ditch where water can accumulate we would plant a series of 8-10 smaller water-tolerant trees like serviceberry and/or eastern redbud. On the upper sides and top of the hill we would plant 6-8 drought-tolerant oaks like shingle, shumard and/or chinkapin oak. This would give us a total of 16-20 trees, with a little flexibility on specific types determined by what is available through local sales and nurseries (some of the trees on this list can be difficult to find). We would try to acquire larger saplings (5 gallons or bigger) when available, especially for the oaks.","The project has several goals and benefits. The site of the planting was a combination of neglected brush and grass, a now-demolished transient motel, and asphalt. The CRSM campus itself is bounded by a major road (Route 120), a strip mall, and a truck lot. This is part of a larger effort to create a more attractive and inviting open space for our students, the school community and visitors. The trees would reduce noise, create much-needed shaded spaces, and provide a location for students and the school community to gather outdoors. The tree planting would be part of a larger effort to create outdoor spaces that promote sustainability and provide education opportunities for our students. Current efforts include a native perennial garden that supports pollinators, a food forest of local native trees, and additional plantings of native trees to increase the campus' tree canopy. The tree planting would be added to an existing science curriculum that addresses local environmental issues like urban heat islands, invasive species, habitat loss, and food deserts. The tree planting itself, as a school-wide event, would be used to increase the awareness of the importance of sustainability, and of trees in particular, as well as the various issues mentioned earlier that face our community here in Waukegan.",3106 Belvidere Road, ,Waukegan,IL,60085,3106 Belvidere Road, ,Waukegan,IL,60085,,"The tree planting would be done by student and staff volunteers, coordinated by the project team. This would be a nearly school-wide event that would take place on a single school day. Several successful gardening and tree planting events have already occurred on campus, so the project team has the knowledge and experience needed to successfully plant and maintain the trees. Facilities staff would be responsible for watering and maintaining the trees, supported by student volunteers and club members during the school year. Watering and inspection of all trees would happen on a weekly basis during the spring and summer of year one (or more depending on weather and soil conditions). Mulching would occur on a monthly basis during the first year, then seasonally in years two and beyond. Although students are not always available, especially during the summer, our paid facilities staff is full time and can support and maintain the trees on a year-round basis.

Several spigots are available on the main building and soccer field concession stand for tree watering. The grant would pay for new hoses needed to reach as many of the trees as possible, as well as portable water containers for trees in more remote areas. This would include the use of watering bags (tree gators) in those areas. The school owns several vehicles (including a light duty tractor) that would be used to deliver mulch and other materials to the tree planting sites. The grant would pay for hand tools and other basic equipment needed by student volunteers or paid staff to plant, mulch and care for the trees.

It Takes A Village Family of Schools,8.0,"Our project will plant eight trees in the currently open grassy play area shared by two early childhood centers on the urban northwest side of Chicago. This area currently lacks tree cover, leaving children and staff exposed to the elements, with limited shade and few natural features to promote outdoor learning and play. By introducing two Honeylocust, two Littleleaf Linden, two Eastern Redbud, and two Sugar Maple trees, we aim to create a vibrant, shaded, and ecologically rich environment that will benefit the centers and their surrounding community.

The chosen tree species were selected for their ability to thrive in urban conditions, provide seasonal interest, and support local biodiversity. Honeylocust trees will offer dappled shade and resilience to pollution, Littleleaf Lindens will contribute dense shade and fragrant blooms, Eastern Redbuds will bring vibrant spring flowers, and Sugar Maples will provide stunning fall foliage. Together, these trees will enhance the visual appeal of the area, improve air quality, and moderate temperatures for children during outdoor activities.

This initiative will be a collaborative effort involving staff, parents, and community volunteers. Before planting, we will conduct a site analysis to determine the best locations for the trees, ensuring they do not interfere with existing play structures or underground utilities. Planting events will serve as community engagement opportunities, where participants can learn about the benefits of urban forestry, tree care techniques, and environmental stewardship.

In addition to the physical planting, this project will incorporate educational elements for the children and their families. The trees will become living learning tools, with opportunities for students to observe seasonal changes, measure growth, and learn about local ecosystems. Informational signage will be installed to educate the broader community about the importance of trees in urban settings.

Over the next ten years, the project will include a comprehensive maintenance plan to ensure the trees establish and thrive. This plan will include watering, mulching, pruning, and monitoring for pests or disease. We will work with local arborists and forestry experts to provide guidance and training for staff and volunteers.

We aim to create a healthier, more inviting space for the children and their families while contributing to Chicago’s urban canopy and promoting environmental equity. ","Our project envisions a transformative annual tree planting campaign that will enhance urban tree canopy coverage in Chicago’s neighborhoods, particularly targeting the disadvantaged area of the Humboldt Park neighborhood on Chicago's Northwest Side. This inaugural initiative aims to engage the community through monthly informational meetings, where residents can learn about the benefits of increased tree coverage and participate in the campaign’s activities.

The Village Roots tree planting program will directly benefit children from birth to age five attending ITAV’s two early learning centers by transforming their outdoor play area into a shaded, nature-rich space that supports physical activity, cognitive development, and emotional well-being. The increased tree canopy will protect children from extreme weather, improve air quality, and reduce urban heat island effects, contributing to their overall health. By bringing trees to a previously barren area in a historically underserved urban neighborhood, the project advances environmental justice, ensuring equitable access to green spaces for children and families who might otherwise lack such resources. 

Additionally, the program will foster a sense of community pride and ownership, encouraging broader environmental awareness and advocacy. We also hope to inspire a new generation of environmental leaders by integrating tree care and environmental education into early childhood learning, creating lasting benefits for the children, families, and the community as a whole.

The secondary beneficiaries will be local residents who will enjoy improved air quality, reduced heat, and enhanced community aesthetics from a greater tree canopy. The campaign will also foster community pride and collective action, empowering residents to advocate for sustainable environmental policies.

We recognize potential barriers to engagement, particularly in disadvantaged neighborhoods. To address this, we will establish a neighborhood coalition with local organizations, leveraging trusted community leaders to facilitate outreach. Our approach includes hosting accessible, multilingual events and providing transportation assistance, ensuring that all voices are heard. By actively seeking feedback, we will tailor our efforts to meet specific community needs, fostering deeper connections and sustainable change.

Ultimately, this project will not only increase tree canopy coverage but also build a stronger, more engaged community committed to environmental stewardship.",4020 W. Division St. ,,Chicago,Illinois,60651,2240 W. Ogden Ave,2nd Fl.,Chicago,IL,60612,"While the Village Roots project does not have a direct workforce development plan, it will play a key role in supporting workforce development through our Grassroots Campaign curriculum, which is integrated into our project-based learning approach for over 300 Kindergarten through 8th grade students. The project provides a unique opportunity for students to engage in real-world environmental work, fostering skills that are applicable to both urban forestry and broader career pathways in the environmental sector.

As part of the curriculum, students will learn about the entire lifecycle of the tree planting process, from the initial planning and site assessments to the long-term care and maintenance of the trees. They will actively participate in hands-on activities, including planting, mulching, watering, and monitoring the health of the trees. Through this, they will gain practical experience in sustainable environmental practices and urban tree care, skills that are directly applicable to careers in urban forestry, environmental science, and landscaping.

In addition to the technical skills, students will develop critical soft skills such as teamwork, problem-solving, and communication as they collaborate with peers, community members, and local experts. They will also gain exposure to the importance of environmental stewardship and the potential for green jobs in their own community. The project will highlight various career pathways in urban forestry and related fields, helping students to understand how their classroom learning can connect to future job opportunities.
This project also provides an opportunity for students to work alongside local professionals and community volunteers, offering mentorship and insight into the workforce. By integrating this real-world project into their curriculum, we are not only enhancing their environmental knowledge but also preparing them for potential future careers in green industries, further strengthening the link between community development and workforce readiness. Through the Village Roots initiative, students will gain valuable experiences that lay the foundation for future career growth while contributing to the environmental health of their community.","The Village Roots tree planting initiative is designed to ensure the successful planting and long-term survival of eight trees through a structured, collaborative approach. Proper planting is critical for tree health, and our team will follow industry best practices. Each tree will be planted in a carefully prepared site with soil optimized for root growth through testing, aeration, and the addition of organic compost. Holes will be dug to the appropriate depth and width to allow for healthy root expansion, and trees will be positioned with their root flares slightly above ground level to prevent girdling and rot. After planting, we will backfill the soil, water thoroughly to eliminate air pockets, and apply a 2-3 inch layer of mulch around each tree. The mulch will help retain moisture, regulate soil temperature, and suppress weeds, with care taken to avoid piling it against the trunk to prevent rot and pests.

Consistent watering during the establishment period is vital for the trees’ survival, especially in the first three years. Each tree will receive 10 gallons of water weekly during the growing season, delivered using slow-release watering bags to ensure even distribution and reduce evaporation. This schedule will be adjusted based on weather conditions, with additional watering provided during heat waves or droughts. Volunteers, staff, and students will be trained in proper watering techniques to ensure that deep, infrequent watering encourages strong root growth.

Education will play a key role in the long-term maintenance of these trees. We will host workshops and on-site training sessions led by urban forestry experts to teach community members, volunteers, and staff the essentials of tree care. These sessions will cover mulching, watering, recognizing signs of stress or disease, and performing seasonal maintenance tasks. To reinforce this knowledge, we will distribute printed and digital materials outlining maintenance procedures and troubleshooting tips. By equipping those involved with the skills and understanding needed for tree care, we create a foundation for sustainable community stewardship.
The responsibility for long-term maintenance will be shared among several groups. Community volunteers who participate in the planting events will be encouraged to adopt specific trees, taking charge of watering and basic care tasks. ITAV Leadership Academy students and staff will incorporate tree care into their educational programming, using the trees as living tools for lessons in ecology and environmental responsibility. These students will monitor tree health, measure growth, and contribute to regular maintenance efforts, such as watering and mulching. Partner organizations, including Openlands and Southwest Collective, will provide ongoing support and periodic health assessments, while local arborists will be engaged for specialized care needs, such as pruning mature trees or addressing pest infestations.

To ensure the trees’ long-term survival, we will implement a robust monitoring system to track their health and address issues promptly. Regular inspections will help identify signs of stress, disease, or pests, allowing for timely intervention. Community ownership will be fostered through volunteer involvement and annual tree care events, where residents can come together to assess progress, refresh mulch, and celebrate the growth of the urban canopy. By building community pride and responsibility, we strengthen the commitment to maintaining these trees.

In addition, we will work with local officials to advocate for policies that support urban forestry and secure resources for green space maintenance. In the event of extreme weather or other challenges, contingency plans will provide additional resources, such as water trucks or tree stabilization tools. These efforts will create a safety net to protect the trees from unforeseen threats.
Through careful planning, education, and the shared efforts of a dedicated community, the Village Roots initiative will not only establish these trees but ensure they thrive for decades to come. This comprehensive approach will enhance the urban canopy, foster environmental equity, and leave a lasting legacy of health and sustainability in our community.","['Sugar Maple', 'Redbud', 'Littleleaf Linden', 'Honeylocust', 'Eastern Redbud', 'Maple']","{'Honeylocust': 2, 'Littleleaf Linden': 2, 'Eastern Redbud': 2, 'Sugar Maple': 2}","['Enhance urban tree canopy coverage in Humboldt Park neighborhood', 'Transform outdoor play area of ITAV’s early learning centers into a nature-rich space', 'Protect children from extreme weather and improve air quality', 'Reduce urban heat island effects', 'Advance environmental justice by bringing trees to underserved urban neighborhood', 'Foster sense of community pride and ownership', 'Inspire a new generation of environmental leaders', 'Improve air quality, reduced heat, and enhanced community aesthetics for local residents', 'Empower residents to advocate for sustainable environmental policies', 'Establish a neighborhood coalition with local organizations', 'Host accessible, multilingual events and provide transportation assistance', 'Tailor efforts to meet specific community needs', 'Build a stronger, more engaged community committed to environmental stewardship']"
Urban Ecology Center,10.0,"Support will go towards the land stewardship work at the Urban Ecology Center which will continue to rejuvenate the green spaces in Washington Park and Three Bridges Park. These urban parks are in historically underserved communities where improving green spaces will have the greatest impact. The two main pieces of this project are: tree planting and job training. 

Tree Planting: The parks managed by the UEC include a variety of ecosystems such as oak savannas, prairies, and a lagoon. Different plants and restoration strategies are used in order to create the optimal growth and change over time. Tree species and individual specimens will be strategically selected to bolster species richness, ecotype genetics, and climate adaptability. Ten new species will be introduced throughout UEC managed park land. Individual specimens of varying age will be installed to ensure multiple generations and natural ecosystem succession. There will be a variety of 25-gallon, 10-gallon, 5-gallon, 3-gallon, 2-gallon, 1-gallon size trees planted. A few examples of species are: Quercus bicolor, Quercus imbricaria, and Ulmus americana “Princeton.” All species chosen will be from the approved species list.

Job Training: In addition to the management of the land, the UEC also works to provide people of all ages the opportunity to learn more about nature and prepare for a career in a green field such as forest management. The Center’s Green Career Pathway engages people of all ages, backgrounds, and interests in studies of ecology, volunteerism, environmental justice, and much more. The program's vision is to inspire youth and young adults in the socially and culturally diverse communities we serve to build environmental curiosity and open pathways to green career opportunities. Like an ecosystem, diversity is key for a thriving environment. Early in the pathway, students are taught about ecosystems and are able to spend time outdoors. As these students grow, they are able to access more specialized knowledge related to environmental management. After a person has graduated from high school, they become eligible for the UEC’s Summer Internship program. This is a paid internship over the summer where people are able to join a team and gain hands-on experience. The Land Management team’s intern helps with work such as planting native species, removing invasive species, and trail maintenance.","The Urban Ecology Center (UEC), a non-profit in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, has the mission to connect people in cities to nature and each other. The Center seeks to broaden exposure to the burgeoning field of green careers and intentionally expand tree-related programming for underserved community members.
Each of the branches is targeted to serve communities within a two-mile radius. Over 100,000 people live within a two mile radius of each of these parks, making them some of the most densely populated neighborhoods in the state. Two of the branch locations, Washington Park (census tract 55079009600), and Menomonee Valley (census tract 55079186800), are in census tracts that qualify as disadvantaged on the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool and the EPA IRA Disadvantaged Communities mapping tools. Riverside Park (census tract 55079007800) is surrounded by census tracts that qualify as disadvantaged neighborhoods, and seeks to alleviate nature deprivation that these neighborhoods experience by providing high quality programming and access to green space. These census tracts experience high burdens in several categories, including: Low Income, Energy Cost, Climate Change, Health, Housing, Lead Paint, Legacy Pollution, Waste and Wastewater, and Workforce Development. This combination of complex burdens creates a dire need for additional services and community outreach efforts to offset the many challenges that these areas face. 
Two ways that the Center combats these barriers is through access to community education opportunities and exposure to green career opportunities. This grant would allow the Land Management team to develop a workforce development curriculum, host community workshops related to the urban tree canopy, and train additional interns in green careers. In addition, the Land Management team would focus efforts on making green careers and spaces more accessible and inclusive to people of different backgrounds, particularly in Spanish and ADA accessibility. As part of this effort, Land Management will work with the Marketing Department to create inclusive signage across our branch locations. The People and Culture team will continue to explore ways to recruit a more diverse pool of applicants for internship and apprenticeship positions.

The Urban Ecology Center’s Neighborhood Environmental Education Project hosted more than 28,000 student visits annually across our three branches in the 2023-2024 school year.  

The next step in the Green Career Pathway is the High School Outdoor Leadership (HSOL) program. This program builds capacity for youth by learning about green careers, getting outside, making friends, and getting paid. The HSOL program is a unique paid internship that helps teens build a wide range of skills including leadership, studies of ecology, environmental justice, and job-readiness. The Center's goal is to provide high school students with the resources and guidance to make connections within themselves, their communities, and nature. 

The Green Career Pathway continues with the Land Management internship. High school graduates with an interest in nature are encouraged to apply for this internship, which provides an immersive experience in a green career and deepens capacity for young people to combat inequities in access to nature.  Through these programs, students and adults will become more aware of our urban tree canopy and take action to care for them and/or enter a forestry career. There are currently three summer Land Management interns in an 11-week program and two advanced interns (Field Technicians) in a 20-week program.  In years two and three of the grant period, the Land Management team will seek to increase the number of summer interns (from 3 to 6) and advanced interns (from 2 to 3) that they hire to further expand access to green careers. 

The Green Career Pathway at the Urban Ecology Center is recursive. When students visit the parks with their classmates, they are able to learn about nature in green spaces that have been maintained and cared for by the Land Management team and their interns. Every child who gets to walk through the woods and dream of a lifetime spent caring for the environment is nurtured by the urban forests stewarded by the UEC's dedicated and enthusiastic Land Management team. ","The Urban Ecology Center is meeting the need for more accessible parks by partnering with Milwaukee County Parks and the City of Milwaukee to manage the land on three previously under-resourced green spaces and provide outdoor programming to children and adults. Many of the 80+ acres managed by the Center were once polluted brown fields or neglected land. Through careful land restoration practices the parks now flourish as urban nature centers which feature a diverse collection of ecosystems such as Wisconsin prairie and oak savanna.

The Land Management team, with the support of volunteers, plans to plant approximately 250 new trees in the next three years. These diverse tree plantings will increase the urban tree canopy in underserved census tracts. By planting native species of trees and shrubs, removing invasive species, controlling erosion, facilitating prescribed burns, and monitoring the plants and animals in our parks, the Land Management team is healing urban nature and creating a vibrant space for students, families and the community to learn and come together to mitigate challenges from nature deprivation in urban areas.

In addition to tree planting, the Land Management team is dedicated to urban canopy maintenance. In preparation for future tree planting, the Urban Ecology Center will be removing 75% of all dead and dying trees due to Emerald Ash borer. The remaining 25% will persist to enrich wildlife foraging, sheltering, and nesting habitat. Tree species and individual specimens will be strategically selected to bolster species richness, ecotype genetics, and climate adaptability. Ten new species will be introduced throughout UEC managed park land. Individual specimens of varying age will be installed to ensure multiple generations and natural ecosystem succession. After planting, trees will be properly mulched and pruned as needed. During the growing season rainfall will be tracked so that additional water can be provided to young growing trees (10 gallons of water per tree every week). Year round, the trees will be monitored and maintained by the UEC’s Land Management team. 

The Land Management team engages thousands of volunteers in its efforts, and in the process, participants are able to take ownership of our shared public places while providing ecological health and dynamic recreational opportunities for our local communities.

The Land Management team hosts an on-going “Restoring Our Outdoors Together” (ROOT) volunteer program, where community members are invited to improve the biodiversity and ecological integrity of the natural areas we manage through planting, invasive species removal, trail work, etc. 

The core goals of the land stewardship work include:
Increased educational awareness on sustainable land stewardship practices.
Expand green career opportunities for community members.
Side-by-side learning through more than 5,500 hours of volunteer support.
Deterred vandalism and illicit activity through volunteer activity and educational programs. 
Increased quality of habitats for environmental education and Center programming.
Increased park visits - the Center aims to welcome at least 600,000 children and families to the parks for educational and recreational programming each year.

The variety of programs at the UEC will engage the Milwaukee community in educational opportunities to expand knowledge about urban forestry.  Implementation of this project will build on existing UEC programs by directly impacting the Center’s ability to sustain these parks as natural resources for future generations and expand the urban tree canopy.

Northwest Side Community Development Corporation,20.0,"Our microforest project includes planting and long-term maintenance of 20 new native trees at Green Tech Station. A tight cluster of trees planted in close proximity to each other can help educate people on the fact that a mixture of different sized trees can work in small spaces. A microforest will create a unique place that allows the trees to grow similar to a natural forest setting. Trees in this area will grow in different height classes and allow people to understand that areas densely planted with trees can be an inviting, beautiful, and ecologically diverse place, even in a highly urbanized setting.

Our project also includes a youth-centered career development component where we will work with a cohort of young people to learn about tree planting and care so they get hands-on experience and explore careers as arborists, engineers, stormwater professionals, and other water and environment-related jobs. Reflo is already a key leader in creating Milwaukee's Environmental Youth Collaborative initiative (EYC), which now includes 13 local organizations working together to make a larger impact in our communities. The EYC group visited Green Tech Station in 2024, and our plan is to continue hosting future cohorts of young people to do various tasks, workshops, and tutorials each year of this grant period. 

Our tree list is as follows:
Amelanchier laevis / Allegheny Serviceberry 
Carpinus caroliniana / American Hornbeam 
Celtis occidentalis / Common Hackberry 
Quercus bicolor / Swamp White Oak 
Quercus rubra / Red Oak 
Quercus x schuetti / Swamp Bur Oak 
Gymnocladus dioicus / Kentucky Coffee Tree
Aesculus glabra / Ohio Buckeye
Thuja occidentalis / Northern White Cedar
Liriodendron tulipifera /  Tulip Tree
Ulmus x 'Morton Glossy' / TriumphTM Elm*
Gleditsia triacanthos inermis 'Shademaster' / Shademaster Honey Locust*
Carya ovata / Shagbark Hickory*
Acer x freemanii `Jeffsred` / Autumn Blaze Maple*
Ostrya virginiana / American Hophornbeam*

*Note that these last five species with an asterisk were not on the pre-approved list but we did receive permission via email to plant these species as part of our project.","Project Beneficiaries
The main beneficiaries of this project will be K-12 students who visit Green Tech Station on field trips each year. We host Milwaukee Public Schools (MPS) students of all ages during the school year and engage these youth in a variety of activities, including measuring tree height, tree species identification, seasonal scavenger hunts focused on pollinators and wildlife, leaf collection, and much more. According to MPS, the district currently serves 69,115 students with a student population that surpasses 90% students of color, over 84% economically disadvantaged, over 20% students with special needs, and a growing English learner population of more than 13%. The new trees that will be planted as part of Green Tech Station's microforest will add more depth to the current educational programming and allow visiting students to see examples of a real life forest right in the middle of the city. 

Of course, we also invite the broader community to visit Green Tech Station, so the beneficiaries are not only limited to Milwaukee youth. The neighborhoods near Green Tech Station are roughly 80-90% African American and have higher than average rates of poverty and unemployment. Further, a study by the Trust for Public Land notes that in Milwaukee, residents in Black neighborhoods have access to 41% less park space per person that the City's average neighborhood and 69% less than those in White neighborhoods. 

We envision that by adding this microforest as part of the site, it will create an even deeper draw for more visitors, both in and outside of the City of Milwaukee, including: organizations, businesses, educational institutions, nonprofits, residents, researchers, arborists and forestry groups, urban planners, advocacy groups, religious groups or congregations, and media.

Supporting Environmental Justice
This work supports environmental justice as a main focal point because Green Tech Station is an urban oasis in the center of Milwaukee's 30th Street Industrial Corridor, in census tracts that have been identified as disinvested in for decades and are experiencing inequities. By investing in green spaces that promote better ecological health, innovative stormwater management, and environmental education for vulnerable youth, we are achieving all of the goals of this grant program.

The project will also help improve air and water quality since trees help absorb carbon dioxide and filter pollutants, which is of particular importance since the neighborhood near Green Tech Station was historically dominated by industrial uses which has left contamination in the air and ground. Trees also help absorb stormwater to manage runoff to reduce flooding and the risk of combined sewer overflows into our local rivers and to Lake Michigan. All this helps Milwaukee build up climate resilience, which has been an important goal identified in recent climate planning efforts that cross various governmental departments.

The microforest also is one small step in reversing disinvestment trends and signaling to nearby residents that this neighborhood is deserving of investment. Further, the emphasis on equitable distribution of resources when it comes to environmental benefits shows that wealthier neighborhoods are not the only neighborhoods who should have access to tree canopies and ecological diversity. The new trees will not only send this message but also help beautify the neighborhood and could potentially catalyze new business and economic development nearby due to improved aesthetics and bolstered activation of this space.

Workforce Development Impacts
Workforce development remains an important pillar of this project. While Green Tech Station has already served as a site for a hands-on tree planting and pruning tutorial in summer 2024, we are excited that this grant will allow us to really expand this part of our programming into an annual workshop serving young people. We will engage Hoppe Tree Service to facilitate demonstrations and interactive workshops about tree planting, long-term care, and more. This will all bring a real-life exposure that careers in arboriculture, urban forestry, and related environmentally-focused industries are high-paying, in-demand, and reachable even without a 4-year college degree. By using our new microforest as an outdoor learning laboratory, we know that we can achieve great success in inspiring Milwaukee's youth to investigate these career paths and that success in these fields is highly achievable.

Additional Benefits
We further believe that the 20 new trees will improve the overall ecology and wildlife habitat in a highly urbanized area, offering opportunities for various birds to nest and pollinators to thrive. The improvements to Green Tech Station will also continue to improve the aesthetics and appeal of Green Tech Station to residents and visitors to Milwaukee as well, hopefully continuing to highlight the kind of work that we do as a means of promoting community and economic development in a disinvested part of the City.

Measurable Outcomes & Broader Impacts 
 - Plant and maintain 20 new trees over the course of the grant.
 - Train a new cohort of youth annually in urban forestry skills.
 - Facilitate workshops that reach 100+ youth and community members.
 - Increase awareness of career pathways in arboriculture, urban forestry, and related fields.
 - Enhance the ecological health and aesthetics at Green Tech Station, creating a model for urban greening and climate resilience efforts.
 - Bolster community engagement by having Green Tech Station serve as a gathering place and educational resource for the neighborhood.",4101 N. 31st St,,Milwaukee,Wisconsin,53216,"4201 N. 27th Street, 7th Floor", ,Milwaukee,WI,53216,"Our microforest project at Green Tech Station actively supports urban and community forestry workforce development by combining hands-on training, career exposure, and long-term site management in an urban setting. This initiative cultivates skills and awareness among young people while addressing environmental challenges in a historically underserved area of Milwaukee.

Hands-On Training & Career Exploration
A central pillar of the project is engaging youth in meaningful, practical experiences that build their knowledge of urban forestry and related fields. The microforest will serve as an outdoor learning laboratory, offering workshops and activities that emphasize tree planting, maintenance, and ecological stewardship. Partnering with Hoppe Tree Service, we will provide expert-led demonstrations on tree planting techniques, proper spacing, mulching, watering, and long-term care such as pruning and fertilization. Youth participants will have the opportunity to directly apply these skills, fostering a sense of ownership and confidence.

We will also integrate career exploration into the program by showcasing pathways in arboriculture, urban forestry, stormwater management, and other environmental fields, making these careers seem more accessible to Milwaukee’s youth, especially those from underrepresented backgrounds.

Integration with Milwaukee’s Environmental Youth Collaborative
Reflo’s leadership in Milwaukee’s Environmental Youth Collaborative (EYC) positions the microforest project as part of a larger, citywide effort to empower young people through environmental education and action. The EYC’s network of 13 organizations allows for cross-organizational collaboration, ensuring that our workforce development efforts have broader reach and impact. 

Supporting K-12 Education
The project will engage K-12 students during field trips, incorporating activities that align with urban forestry concepts and STEM education. These hands-on experiences introduce students to fundamental ecological principles, such as the role of trees in urban ecosystems, wildlife habitat creation, and stormwater management. For younger students, activities like scavenger hunts and leaf collections spark early interest, while older students can delve deeper into topics like measuring tree growth, analyzing soil health, and identifying career pathways.

Enhancing Workforce Development through Professional Partnerships
Our collaboration with Hoppe Tree Service ensures that youth participants receive high-quality, professional training. Hoppe’s arborists will provide real-world exposure to industry-standard practices, helping participants understand the demands and rewards of urban forestry careers. These workshops will also demystify the industry, showing young people that success is achievable and that their contributions can have tangible impacts on their community.

Promoting Environmental Justice through Workforce Opportunities
Green Tech Station is located in Milwaukee’s 30th Street Industrial Corridor, an area marked by decades of disinvestment and environmental inequities. This project addresses these disparities by creating green spaces that improve ecological health and air and water quality, while simultaneously investing in the local workforce. By equipping youth with skills and knowledge in urban forestry, the project contributes to breaking cycles of inequity by opening doors to stable, well-paying careers. Our approach demonstrates how environmental justice and workforce development can go hand-in-hand, creating a pathway for economic mobility in underserved communities.

Sustained Impact through Long-Term Maintenance
The microforest project is designed for long-term success, ensuring that its workforce development benefits extend well beyond the initial grant period. NWSCDC has signed a 10-year lease to operate and maintain Green Tech Station, absorbing responsibility for tree care and site management. This commitment ensures that the trees—and the educational and workforce opportunities they represent—will thrive for years to come.","Planting & Mulching Plan
Hoppe Tree Service will source the native trees and professionally plant them in our proposed location at the southern end of the site. They will ensure the spacing of the trees is adequate and that they are set up for success with stakes, mulch, and gator bags to slow-release water. Planting will occur in fall 2025, an optimal time of year for trees to be planted and thrive.

Watering Plan
Watering will be handled by NWSCDC staff and Reflo's interns. With access to water on site via the underground cistern, youth interns will be regularly scheduled to maintain the site by filling up the gator bags weekly and removing weeds as needed. If the interns have a conflict, NWSCDC staff will be able to step in and take on the watering on an as needed basis. We are confident in our abilities to do this because we have been through a similar process when more than 20 trees were planted as part of the City's Arbor Day Tree Celebration in 2022, and we ensured the young trees survived that summer (and beyond) using gator bags and water from the cistern. In the first year, watering will occur until the first frost. In 2026 and beyond, watering will occur starting in spring and carry on through the summer and fall seasons, taking into account weather.

Maintenance Plan
The workshops hosted by Hoppe will go over all of the necessary information and techniques needed by anyone participating in maintenance activities and ongoing watering. Hoppe will further be involved by determining the pruning and fertilization needs for the trees after they are planted. Their professional arborist crews will come to the site at least annually to perform various tasks, and as mentioned previously, our project team will work to incorporate those visits into hands-on workshops for youth and community members to learn more about pruning and tree care. Hoppe will be able to provide fertilizer/micronutrient applications annually after the trees are planted in addition to pruning and other maintenance tasks. NWSCDC will ensure these visits are scheduled in a timely manner.

NWSCDC has signed a 10-year lease to operate and maintain Green Tech Station and will therefore absorb responsibility for maintaining the health of the trees even beyond the scope of this grant.","['Cedar', 'Ostrya virginiana', 'Allegheny Serviceberry', 'White Oak', 'Hophornbeam', 'Locust', 'Serviceberry', 'Quercus bicolor', 'Quercus rubra', 'Tulip', 'Elm', 'Aesculus glabra', 'Ohio Buckeye', 'Gleditsia triacanthos', 'Oak', 'Bur Oak', 'Amelanchier laevis', 'Liriodendron tulipifera', 'Buckeye', 'Gymnocladus dioicus', 'Carpinus caroliniana', 'Maple', 'Swamp White Oak', 'Shagbark Hickory', 'American Hornbeam', 'Celtis occidentalis', 'White Cedar', 'Common Hackberry', 'Thuja occidentalis', 'Hackberry', 'Coffee', 'Carya ovata', 'Hornbeam']","{'Amelanchier laevis': 1, 'Carpinus caroliniana': 1, 'Celtis occidentalis': 1, 'Quercus bicolor': 1, 'Quercus rubra': 1, 'Quercus x schuetti': 1, 'Gymnocladus dioicus': 1, 'Aesculus glabra': 1, 'Thuja occidentalis': 1, 'Liriodendron tulipifera': 1, 'Ulmus x ""Morton Glossy""': 2, 'Gleditsia triacanthos inermis ""Shademaster""': 1, 'Carya ovata': 1, 'Acer x freemanii `Jeffsred`': 1, 'Ostrya virginiana': 1}","['Engage K-12 students in environmental education', 'Enhance Green Tech Station for visiting students', 'Attract broader community visitors', 'Support Environmental Justice by creating an urban oasis', 'Improve air and water quality through tree planting', 'Increase climate resilience', 'Signal investment in the neighborhood', 'Promote equitable distribution of resources', 'Beautify the neighborhood and potentially catalyze new development', 'Provide workforce development opportunities in arboriculture and urban forestry', 'Improve overall ecology and wildlife habitat', 'Increase awareness of career pathways in related fields', 'Train a new cohort of youth annually', 'Facilitate workshops for 100+ youth and community members', 'Plant and maintain 20 new trees', 'Enhance ecological health and aesthetics at Green Tech Station', 'Bolster community engagement']"
One Life Ministries Inc,20.0,"The Sacred Forest project will provide shade, beauty, soil stability and abundance on the grounds of The Table Episcopal Church by planting twenty trees. Seven of these trees will create a peach and cherry orchard to extend the work of the Peace Garden. (The varieties planted will include Elberta, Harvester, Majestic peaches, and Lapins, Stella, and Rainier cherries.) The other thirteen trees will include three Northern Pecans, two Sunflower PawPaws, two Pennsylvania Golden PawPaws, three Serviceberries, and three hazelnuts.

We will ensure the flourishing of the trees by designating the Project Coordinator as the person responsible for weekly watering and maintenance, and by involving the service of a consulting arborist. Farmer Tate Nielsen and the Peace Garden volunteer team will participate in the care of the orchard trees, while Table youth will also tend trees through the Forest Keepers program. 

The Sacred Forest will provide learning and education opportunities for all ages in our church: children will participate in a forest-themed liturgical arts project; youth will be invited to become Forest Keepers, gaining urban forestry skills while learning about potential careers in the field; and adults will have opportunity to participate in a class on climate and creation care as well as urban forestry workshops offered at our twice-yearly Sacred Forest events. Our church Table Groups (small groups) will also be invited to participate in Creation Care evenings, gathering for a meal at church instead of in a home and then watering the trees alongside the Project Coordinator. 

The biannual Sacred Forest events will help our congregation connect with our new neighborhood. Beginning with a planting day party involving food, live music, and tree planting training led by Master Gardener Angie Capps, these gatherings will foster congregation-neighborhood relationships through shared work in a shared space. Participants will gain skills in community and urban forestry, while also building relationships that allow us to better seek one another’s good. 

As the trees mature, foraging and wildcrafting workshops will be led by the Project Coordinator. These workshops will contribute to food security in our neighborhood by introducing community members to the food freely available from the forest trees. They will also foster a sense of reciprocity between participants and the living world, as the trees we have worked to care for begin to feed us in return.","The Sacred Forest project is inspired by the good work of churches in northern Ethiopia, where walled church grounds preserve vibrant oases in degraded agricultural lands. Some of the last refuges for vanishing wildlife and shelters in an encroaching desert, these church forests preserve living communities by extending the protection of the sanctuary out onto the land. We hope to do the same. 

While the ground under our feet is not turning to sand, The Table Episcopal Church is located in a designated food desert. Our neighborhood bears ugly marks of urban neglect: shuttered amenities, aging housing, and too many vacancies. Where the more-than-human world isn’t paved over, it straggles in lawns or clumps of invasive thistle and honeysuckle. 

By planting a sacred forest that includes both an orchard and native fruit and nut trees, we hope to benefit our immediate neighbors, the community served by Lawrence Township food pantries, children and adults in our congregation, and the wider living webs of soil life, insects, birds, plants and mammals that struggle in an urban/suburban environment. 

The church’s immediate neighbors will be able to enjoy increasing beauty, shade and improved air quality as the sacred forest matures. Trees mitigate the heat island effect. This summer, Indianapolis’ Community Canopy Alliance (CCA) measured a 14-degree difference between a shaded, affluent neighborhood and a treeless, disenfranchised neighborhood less than four miles apart. CCA also argues that shade “cools hearts and minds,” as well as bodies, noting that violent crime statistics are higher in heat island neighborhoods. Researchers in Baltimore confirmed this, reporting a 10% increase in canopy coverage tracking with a 12% decrease in violent crime. Decreasing violence is central to the mission of the Peace Garden, whose street-facing side is lined with rows of stark white crosses marking the yearly count homicides in Indianapolis. By planting trees like the large-canopied pecans, we will decrease the heat island effect and bolster the health and safety of our neighbors—a vital intervention as climate change worsens. 

Because we worship in a food desert, we are opting to plant all food-bearing trees. The peach and cherry trees in the Peace Garden’s orchard will extend the fresh produce offerings available in Lawrence Township food banks, promoting residents’ health and delight. The native fruit and nut trees will be available to all neighborhood residents. Neighbors already take a lively interest in harvesting their own food from the Peace Garden. The harvest from the native fruit and nut trees will be free to all, and our church will conduct foraging and cooking classes out of our kitchen to educate people about the uses of these wild foods as the trees mature. Open to both neighbors and congregants, these classes will provide a space for creating and strengthening greater relationships between local and worshiping communities. 

We also expect our congregation to benefit from this project in numerous ways. Up until October, our church community worshiped in a series of temporary spaces across the city. Our transient status limited the work we could do for any one place. Now housed permanently in a building owned by our diocese, we finally have the opportunity to translate belief to action and enact the creation care we’ve long discussed. Action metabolizes despair, and in the face of the climate catastrophe and the re-election of Trump, our community needs a hands-in-the-dirt project to rally around. As the forest matures, it will provide both a focal point for congregational gathering through biannual Sacred Forest events, Creation Care nights, and foraging classes, as well as an outdoor setting for traditional church events like the Stations of the Cross. 

Youth in the congregation will benefit from the Forest Keepers program, receiving a stipend as they learn and practice the skills of urban forestry and consider the career opportunities it involves. Our children will engage in the hope and beauty of the forest through a community art project created by Liturgical Arts Coordinator Becca Ito, allowing them to channel their climate anxiety in a constructive direction. We also hope to extend the educational benefits of the Sacred Forest through partnership with the Peace Garden, re-opening conversations they initiated with local schools and 4-H groups. 

On the economic side, large trees planted to the south of our building will grow to reduce cooling costs, while maturing trees will aid the transition of lawn to native woodland, thus decreasing lawncare costs to the church. 

Finally, the Sacred Forest will help re-weave webs of life in our small corner of Indianapolis. Forest duff added to tree planting holes will reinvigorate mycorrhizal communities on city sod, while compost and mulch will further boost soil life. Increasing the native tree population on church grounds will provide habitat for insects, birds, and mammals, while fruits and nuts will create more abundant food for these populations. 

At a time when so much American Christian language has thrown its support behind white Christian nationalism, this Sacred Forest project will help our community reclaim the language of sanctity or sanctus—holiness as wholeness, sanctuary as a place of flourishing for human and more-than-human communities together. We hope it will also inspire other churches in our neighborhood, several of whom also sit on large tracts of lawn. We see this food forest as a pilot project, equipping us with the experience and tools of urban forestry that we can go on to share with other houses of worship, building a mycelial network of churches stewarding trees and mutual flourishing in Indianapolis.",4601 N Emerson Ave, ,Indianapolis,IN,46226,4601 N Emerson Ave, ,Indianapolis,IN,46226,"The Sacred Forest project supports urban and community forestry workforce development by strengthening the work of the Peace Garden, involving all ages of the church community, and building bridges with the local neighborhood. 

With the orchard expansion of the Peace Garden, longtime farmer Tate Nielsen is excited to learn the new skills of fruit tree pruning and treatment. He is making plans to connect with the Midwest Fruit and Nut Growers’ Association for support. Planting an orchard alongside a functioning market garden creates an ideal educational space to introduce children to where food comes from, and The Table is in conversation with Tate and Joan about reviving the Peace Garden’s pre-COVID plans to offer the space to local schools or 4-H groups. 

Within the congregation of The Table, the Sacred Forest project is designed to invite everyone in. Adults regardless of physical ability will be able to attend the Climate and Creation Care class in the winter, learning about the urgency and benefits of urban forests. GroupMe posts, Instagram content, and quarterly updates in the church newsletter will continue to keep this wide engaged in the forestry conversation. Those interested and able to get their hands dirty will be able to join the work on Planting Day, where tree-planting training will be provided Master Gardner Angie Capps and farmer MaryEllen, allowing members to gain valuable skills. Subsequent Creation Care nights tailored to Table small groups will invite smaller groups of adults to participate in the ongoing work of tree care, providing further training and exposure to the work of urban forestry. Particularly for younger adults in the church, these events allow for rare contact with trees and soil—the kind of encounter that can kindle latent love for the work of urban forestry. 

Youth engagement is designed even more specifically toward workforce development. Youth in the Forest Keepers program will be paid a stipend to care for trees on a weekly basis. This care will include hands-on training in tree maintenance, as well as five lessons adapted from the American Forest Tree Equity curriculum, specifically designed to expose high school students to possible careers in the forestry workforce. 

Children will bond with the trees through a forest-themed Liturgical Arts project which they will work on during Sunday service over the course of several weeks. The details are still being developed by our Liturgical Arts coordinator, but past projects have included a labyrinth and flocks and herds of origami creatures. Explicitly engaging a creation-care-themed project will provide a constructive space for children to act on the climate anxiety we often hear them express. Artistic engagement with the forest will prime their interest for more hands-on work as they get older. 

Lastly, the Sacred Forest will promote community forestry workforce development by inviting members of the neighborhood community to join for Planting Day, offering them access to the same hands-on skills provided to church members. At the time of the first Serviceberry harvest (expected in year two or three of this project), a foraging and wildcrafting class will be offered to neighbors and church members. By learning to identify, harvest, and prepare wild foods, participants will strengthen their sense of food security, as well as their attentiveness to and appreciation of local trees. It’s hard not to love a tree that’s fed you. ","Planting Plan:
To ensure the long-term survival and flourishing of the trees, we will implement a comprehensive maintenance plan following the guidelines of the US Forest Service’s Tree Owner Manual. The plan includes:
• Year 1:
o Preparation: Soil tests will be done in both planting locations prior to April, to determine if any amendments are necessary. 
o Planting: Trees will be planted in the spring after the last frost date.
o Mulching: A 4-inch layer of mulch will be applied around each tree to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature. Care will be taken that mulch does not touch the trunk.
o Watering: Trees will be watered with ten gallons of water a week during the first growing season to establish strong roots. Irrigation bags will dispense water to the roots at a measured rate.
o Education: On the day of planting, training sessions led by Master Gardener Angie Capps, Farmer Mary Ellen, and Project Coordinator Leah McMichael will be conducted for volunteers on proper watering and mulching techniques.
o Monitoring: Weekly monitoring will be conducted by the Project Coordinator, supplemented by an annual visit from an arborist. This will allow us to identify any issues early and address them promptly. 
o Responsibility: The Project Coordinator will be responsible for weekly watering. Youth involved in Forest Keepers will assist with a portion of the weekly watering on Sundays. The Project Coordinator will also organize opportunities for church groups and Peace Garden volunteers to water the trees and learn how to care for them.
• Year 2:
o Watering: Trees will receive ten gallons of water weekly, adjusting based on weather conditions to ensure adequate moisture levels.
o Mulching: Mulch will be replenished as needed to maintain a 4-inch layer, ensuring continued protection and nourishment. Weeding as needed.
o Pruning: Light pruning will be conducted to remove any dead or damaged branches, promoting healthy growth. Pruning of orchard trees will be done by Peace Garden Farmer Tate Nielsen, while pruning of other trees will be done by Master Gardener Angie Capps and Project Coordinator Leah McMichael.
o Monitoring: Weekly monitoring will be conducted by the Project Coordinator, supplemented by an annual visit from an arborist. 
o Education: Continued education sessions will be provided to reinforce maintenance practices among youth in Forest Keepers, who will learn how to prune. Bi-annual events will be organized to provide education on the keeping of trees and the benefits of urban forests to the church and neighborhood community.  
o Responsibility: Forest Keepers youth will take on more autonomy in Sunday watering, with the remaining trees watered and monitored by the Project Coordinator. Church groups will be invited to join the watering rotation at least once during the season, to promote a sense of congregational connectedness to the forest.
• Year 3:
o Watering: Trees will receive ten gallons of water weekly, adjusting based on weather conditions to ensure adequate moisture levels.
o Mulching: Mulch will be replenished as needed to maintain optimal soil conditions.
o Pruning: Annual pruning will be performed to shape the trees and remove any problematic branches, supporting long-term health.
o Monitoring: Weekly monitoring will be conducted by the Project Coordinator, supplemented by an annual visit from an arborist. 
o Harvesting: Harvesting will begin as trees mature. Fruit from the orchard trees in the Peace Garden will be harvested by Tate and donated to a food pantry. Fruit and nuts from other trees will be made available to neighborhood and church communities through foraging and wildcrafting education.
o Responsibility: The Forest Keepers and Project Coordinator will continue to be responsible for the watering of trees, with possible partnership from the Peace Garden.

NEW HARMONY NATIVE TREES AND SHRUBS:

For the Love Lamasco Tree Canopy Project, we will plant trees grown by Thomas Guggenheim, a local ISA Certified Arborist. He provides native trees using a patented system that grows containerized plants with superior root structures in local soil. His system results in a low mortality rate and steady growth for the trees (buroak.net).


IN ADVANCE:

Before planting, we will contact the utility location service at 1-888-258-0808 at least 72 hours in advance to ensure safe digging. In addition, we will test the soil and determine tree placement before the planting day.
 
PLANTING:

For planting, we will follow the instructions provided by Thomas Guggenheim for planting trees grown in his patented cylinder containers. Detailed instructions can be found at buroak.net/guidelines. The following is a brief overview:
 
DIG - Dig a cylindrical hole, the depth of which is one inch less than the length of the soil cylinder in the removable container and is 10 to 12 inches in diameter.

PLACE - Examine the tree to be planted. Drop the tube into the hole and orient it so that the tree is vertical and the angle of the trunk is as close to as possible to 90° to the surface of the ground.

FILL - Add finely chopped soil to the space between the sides of the hole and the soil cylinder. Water the soil added to the hole, adding additional soil if necessary.
 
MULCHING:

Following the guidelines from the US Forest Service’s Tree Owner Manual, a layer of mulch will be applied around the base of each tree, 3-4 inches deep. The mulch will be kept away from the trunk to avoid moisture build-up and rot. This mulching technique helps retain soil moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature, which are crucial for young trees’ development.
 
WATERING:

During the growing season, each tree will receive 15 gallons of water per week. Watering will commence in the spring as leaves emerge and continue until they drop in the fall. This regular watering schedule is essential for the trees’ survival and will be modified based on rainfall and specific tree needs. Water will be applied slowly to ensure deep soil penetration and promote strong root growth.
 
EDUCATION AND TRAINING:

Neighbors contracted and responsible for tree maintenance will undergo training sessions led by certified arborists. These sessions will cover essential care practices, including proper watering techniques, mulching, and pruning. Educational materials such as the US Forest Service’s Tree Owner Manual will be distributed to reinforce learning and ensure consistent care.
 
LONG-TERM MAINTENANCE RESPONSIBILITY:

Lamasco neighbors will manage the long-term health of the trees through stipends.  They will also receive ongoing support to perform regular maintenance tasks, such as watering, mulching, pruning, and monitoring tree health. Additionally, we will engage local certified arborists for biannual consultations to provide expert advice and ensure best practices are followed.
 

THREE-YEAR MAINTENANCE PLAN:

 Year 1: Focus on establishing the trees by maintaining consistent watering, mulching, and monitoring for signs of stress or disease. Conduct biannual reviews with a certified arborist to assess the trees’ progress and address any concerns.

 Year 2: Continue regular maintenance activities with a focus on pruning to encourage healthy growth and structure. When possible, engage property owners in the care and maintenance of the trees.
 
Year 3: Transition some maintenance responsibilities to property owners, empowering them to take ownership of the project. Conduct a comprehensive review of the canopy’s health and make any necessary adjustments to care practices.
 
End of Year Three: Meet for a final consultation with a certified arborist to assess the trees’ health and make any necessary adjustments to the care practices. Train property owners to provide ongoing care for the trees,

Below is GSofSI's planting, mulching, and watering plan, maintenance care plan, and the long-term responsibility of the Outreach Tree Project. 
Planting and Mulching Plan:
Planting will take place at nine schools across two local districts in East St. Louis and surrounding areas. Each site will be prepared to ensure the trees thrive.
9 shade trees and 9 fruit bearing trees will be selected based on their adaptability to Southern Illinois' climate and minimal maintenance needs. Trees will be procured from a local, trusted local nursery, Crain Tree Farm. Before planting, each site will be assessed for optimal tree placement, considering factors like sunlight, soil quality, and proximity to buildings or walkways. Proper spacing will be ensured to prevent overcrowding. The school districts will also have say in the placement based on the needs of the school grounds. Holes will be dug at twice the width and the same depth as the tree's root ball to allow roots to spread easily. Trees will be planted at the correct height, ensuring the root flare is visible at the soil line. Further, a 2–3-inch layer of quality grade mulch will be applied around each tree’s base to retain soil moisture and regulate temperature. Mulch will be kept 2–3 inches away from the trunk to prevent rot and pest issues.
Watering Plan:
GSofSI acknowledges that proper hydration is essential, especially in the first three years after planting when trees are still in the process of establishing their root systems. Each tree will receive 10 gallons of water weekly during the growing season (approximately April to October). Naturally, watering will be adjusted based on rainfall. Slow, deep watering methods, such as drip irrigation hoses, will be used to ensure moisture reaches the tree's root zone. Girl Scouts, Outreach staff and local school staff will collaborate to maintain the watering schedule. Girl Scouts will assist (throughout the school year) during weekly outreach visits to reinforce their understanding of tree care and forestry. 
Maintenance Care Plan: 
GSofSI acknowledges that pruning, weeding, and regular inspections for growth is vital to the trees success. Pruning and weeding will be done as needed and inspections will be done at least on a monthly basis. 
Education for Maintenance:
Education is vital to the project’s success. Girl Scouts and adult staff will receive ongoing training to equip them with the knowledge needed for effective care. Before planting, participants will attend an educational experience at a local tree farm. This visit will allow them to learn directly from arborists and forestry experts about proper planting techniques, tree care, and sustainable practices. During the planting phase, experts will guide participants in correctly planting and mulching the trees, reinforcing the skills learned during the tree farm visit. Educational materials will be provided to Outreach staff to ensure everyone understands the care process.
Long Term Responsibilities:
Ensuring the long-term health of the trees will be a top priority for the success of this Tree Canopy project. Girl Scouts will take an active role in weekly watering, mulching, and weeding during their outreach visits. This hands-on involvement reinforces their learning and sense of ownership over the project. During the summer months, Outreach staff will assist in watering and maintenance until the Girl Scouts are back into the classroom from the 9 month school year.. Further, efforts will be made to engage local volunteers and families to support ongoing care. Volunteer days may be organized to ensure tree health and build community engagement. Outreach staff will oversee the overall maintenance plan; any issues identified during monthly inspections will be addressed by the Outreach staff and the Outdoor Program Manager.
Three year timeline (projected):
Year 1:
Planting: Trees will be planted in the spring for optimal growth.
Weekly Watering: Strict adherence to the 10-gallon-per-tree schedule.
Mulching: Mulch applied immediately after planting and replenished as needed.

Housing Authority of Champaign County,35.0,"The goal of the project is to improve environmental sustainability, enhance air quality, and create green spaces in urban areas that have limited tree coverage. Youth participants will be involved in all aspects of the project, including tree planting, ongoing maintenance, and community outreach. They will work alongside trained professionals, gaining valuable skills in urban forestry, landscape management, and ecological restoration.

YouthBuild participants will identify and plant trees in areas that need increased canopy cover, such as parks, schools, and residential neighborhoods. The focus will be on selecting tree species suited to the urban environment, ensuring long-term growth and sustainability such as the Northern Red Oak, Swamp White Oak,Hackberry, White Pine, and Hackberry.

Following planting, youth will be trained in tree care practices such as watering, pruning, mulching, and pest management to ensure the trees thrive. They will also learn about the ecological benefits of urban trees, including air and water quality improvements, temperature regulation, and biodiversity enhancement.

In addition to tree planting, the project will include community outreach efforts to educate local residents about the importance of trees and green spaces. Youth participants will host workshops, create educational materials, and work with local organizations to raise awareness about environmental sustainability.

The project aims to enhance the urban environment by increasing tree canopy coverage, which will have long-term benefits for the community, including improved air quality, reduced heat island effects, and enhanced aesthetics. For the youth involved, the project provides an opportunity to develop career-ready skills, earn certifications, and contribute meaningfully to their communities. By combining environmental stewardship with workforce development, the project offers both immediate and lasting benefits to participants and their neighborhoods.","The primary beneficiaries of the project are youth aged 16-24, particularly those who face barriers to employment and education. By participating in this project, youth will gain hands-on experience in tree planting, care, and maintenance, as well as the chance to earn valuable green certifications. This training will help them build technical and soft skills, preparing them for careers in urban forestry, landscaping, horticulture, and other environmental sectors. Youth will also benefit from mentorship and support that fosters personal growth, improves their work readiness, and boosts their confidence. 

The community will also benefit significantly from the project. The urban area selected for tree planting and beautification will see increased tree canopy cover, which brings a host of environmental and social benefits. These benefits include improved air and water quality, reduced heat island effects, increased biodiversity, and enhanced public spaces for recreation and social interaction. 

 Additionally, environmental groups will benefit through partnerships that promote community-based environmental stewardship and provide mutual support in achieving sustainability goals. Public and private entities invested in improving local green infrastructure will benefit from a trained, job-ready workforce equipped to take on urban greening and maintenance projects. 

 Environmental justice is a core principle of this project. Many urban communities, especially those that are economically disadvantaged or have high minority populations, experience significant environmental inequities, including limited green spaces, poor air quality, and the effects of urban heat islands. These communities often have less access to resources for environmental restoration and struggle with disproportionate environmental burdens. This project will address these disparities by prioritizing tree planting and urban greening in underserved neighborhoods. By increasing tree canopy cover, the project will help mitigate the negative effects of pollution and climate change that disproportionately affect marginalized communities. Trees play a vital role in improving air quality by absorbing pollutants such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter. Additionally, trees help cool urban areas by providing shade, which lowers temperatures and reduces energy costs, making these neighborhoods more resilient to extreme heat events—a common issue in lower-income areas where access to cooling infrastructure may be limited. The inclusion of youth from historically underserved communities in environmental work also provides an opportunity to correct some of the inequities in the environmental sector, where people of color and low-income individuals have been underrepresented. The training, mentorship, and work experience provided through this project offer youth an avenue for gaining entry into green careers, an industry that is expanding but still has gaps in diversity and equity. In this way, the project promotes both environmental and social justice by providing environmental benefits to underserved areas and career opportunities to marginalized youth.

 A significant goal of this project is to foster workforce development by equipping youth with the skills and certifications necessary to succeed in the green economy. As climate change and sustainability efforts continue to grow in importance, green industries are rapidly expanding, but there is often a lack of qualified workers, especially from disadvantaged communities. This project will help bridge that gap by providing participants with the technical training, practical skills, and certifications needed for a successful career in urban forestry and environmental conservation. The program will offer training in various aspects of urban forestry, including tree planting, tree care, pruning, and maintenance, as well as in environmental education, sustainable landscaping, and green infrastructure. Youth will also gain certifications in urban forestry, horticulture, and sustainable landscaping, which will make them competitive candidates for jobs in the green sector. In addition to technical skills, the program will emphasize soft skills such as teamwork, communication, problem-solving, and time management, all of which are essential in any career. Through partnerships with local businesses, environmental organizations, and government agencies, the project will create pathways for job placement and internships, allowing youth to transition from training to employment. These job opportunities could include roles in city parks departments, landscaping companies, municipal tree care programs, or environmental non-profits. By providing this training, certifications, and job placement assistance, the project directly addresses the need for a skilled workforce in the green sector and offers youth a sustainable career pathway that aligns with their interests and community values. 

 ",608 E. University,,Champaign,Illinois,61822,2008 N. Market St., ,Champaign,IL,61822,"This project plays a pivotal role in supporting urban and community forestry workforce development by providing hands-on training, job readiness skills, and career pathways for youth participants, while also engaging the community in long-term urban greening efforts. 

First, the project provides 20 youth participants with training in urban forestry, tree care, and environmental stewardship. Over the course of the project, these young people will gain valuable, industry-specific skills, including:
• Tree planting and maintenance: Learning proper planting techniques, mulching, watering, and pest management.
• Pruning and shaping: Gaining experience in pruning trees for healthy growth and aesthetics, a key skill in urban forestry.
• Environmental assessment: Training participants to recognize and address stressors affecting urban trees, such as disease, pests, and soil issues.

These hands-on activities are supported by certification programs in urban forestry and sustainable landscaping, which will provide participants with formal qualifications, increasing their employability in the green jobs sector.
Participants will also be exposed to career opportunities in urban forestry and the green industry through job readiness workshops, including resume building, interview preparation, and career guidance. This helps prepare them for jobs in fields like landscaping, environmental management, and urban forestry.

Additionally, the project will offer internships and job placement assistance with local employers in the green sector, giving participants a direct path into the workforce once their training is complete. These real-world experiences will increase their chances of securing employment in the growing field of urban greening.

Beyond workforce development for youth, this project engages the broader community in urban forestry through workshops and educational events. These events will increase awareness of the value of trees and the role of urban forestry in building more sustainable, resilient cities. By involving residents in tree care and maintenance, we foster a sense of shared responsibility for urban greening and environmental stewardship.

As the project progresses, we will partner with local governments, environmental organizations, and green industry employers to expand the urban forestry workforce. This will include developing training pipelines for other youth in the community, ensuring a sustainable, skilled labor force for the long-term care of urban green spaces.

In sum, this project not only addresses immediate needs for urban greening but also builds a skilled workforce that will contribute to the ongoing success of urban forestry in the future. Through practical training, career development, and community involvement, we are helping create a sustainable and empowered workforce that is prepared to tackle the challenges of urban greening and environmental conservation.","Before any trees are planted, the site will undergo a thorough preparation process to ensure optimal growing conditions. Each planting site will be assessed for soil quality, sun exposure, and adequate space for mature tree growth. 

Soil will be tested to determine pH and nutrient levels. If needed, adjustments will be made to correct deficiencies (e.g., adding compost to improve soil fertility or organic matter for better drainage). We will also remove any competing vegetation from the planting area to give the new tree the best chance for healthy growth.

The planting hole will be twice the diameter and the same depth as the tree's root ball. The hole will be shaped to accommodate the roots without constriction, ensuring the tree establishes a healthy root system. A layer of mulch will be placed around the hole before planting to protect the roots from extreme temperatures.

The tree will be placed in the center of the hole, with the root collar (the area where the trunk meets the roots) level with the surrounding ground. The roots will be spread out gently to avoid root crowding, and the hole will be filled with native soil, ensuring no air pockets remain. The tree will be watered immediately after planting to help settle the soil and ensure good root-to-soil contact.

A 2-3 inch layer of mulch (such as wood chips or bark) will be applied around the base of each tree to help retain moisture, prevent soil erosion, and suppress weeds. Mulch will be kept away from the trunk to prevent moisture buildup that could lead to fungal diseases.

The mulch will be replenished as needed to maintain a consistent depth and ensure long-term moisture retention and weed suppression. This process will be done during the growing season and adjusted to prevent any mulch from accumulating too close to the base of the tree.

Watering is critical for the establishment of newly planted trees. We will implement a structured watering plan to ensure each tree receives adequate moisture during its first few years, especially during the hot and dry months of the growing season. Watering will be monitored and adjusted based on weather conditions and the specific needs of each tree.

Each tree will receive 10 gallons of water per week during the growing season (typically from April to October). The water will be applied directly to the root zone to encourage deep root growth, rather than surface watering, which promotes shallow root systems.

Watering will be done slowly and deeply, either using a soaker hose, drip irrigation system, or watering cans, ensuring that the water soaks deep into the soil to reach the tree’s root system. This method helps minimize runoff and promotes deep root growth.

 Youth participants will track rainfall to adjust watering schedules. If there is adequate rainfall, the watering will be reduced or suspended. In extreme heat or drought conditions, watering will be increased to ensure survival. Regular checks will be made to ensure that the soil remains moist but not waterlogged.

Education and training are central to the success of the project, particularly when it comes to tree care and long-term sustainability. We will provide comprehensive training for YouthBuild participants involved in tree care, equipping them with the knowledge and skills to maintain healthy trees throughout their lifespan.

YouthBuild participants will receive initial training in tree planting, mulching, and basic tree care before planting takes place. This training will be conducted by certified arborists and experienced environmental educators.
Over the three years, youth participants will continue to receive education on proper tree care, focusing on topics such as:
o Pruning and shaping for healthy growth
o Identifying pests and diseases
o Proper irrigation techniques
o Seasonal care, including fall and spring preparations
o Fertilization, if needed

Ensuring the long-term survival and health of the trees requires a clear plan for ongoing care beyond the initial three-year maintenance phase. This responsibility will be shared between YouthBuild participants, local organizations, and the broader community.

For the first three years, YouthBuild participants will be directly responsible for the weekly watering, mulching, and monitoring of the trees. After the three-year period, YouthBuild will continue to play a key role by training future cohorts of participants to take on these tasks, creating a cycle of ongoing workforce development and environmental stewardship.

Partnerships with local environmental organizations and the city’s parks department will help ensure the continued care of trees. These organizations will be involved in monitoring tree health and providing additional resources as needed. They may also help recruit volunteers to assist with maintenance efforts, ensuring that tree care is a shared community responsibility.

Trees will be monitored annually by professional arborists and local parks departments to ensure that they are growing properly, free from pests and diseases, and receiving the proper amount of care. If issues arise, such as disease or pest infestations, corrective measures will be taken quickly to ensure the health of the trees.

Trees will undergo regular pruning during their first few years to help them develop strong, well-structured canopies. Over time, this will reduce the likelihood of structural problems and improve the tree’s ability to withstand storms and other environmental stresses.

While we expect high survival rates, some trees may not thrive due to unforeseen factors such as extreme weather, pests, or disease. We will establish a tree replacement plan, where any failed trees will be replaced during the next planting season, ensuring that the tree canopy continues to expand.","['Swamp White Oak', 'Northern Red Oak', 'Pine', 'Oak', 'White Oak', 'Hackberry']","{'Northern Red Oak': None, 'Swamp White Oak': None, 'Hackberry': 2, 'White Pine': None}","['Empower Youth', 'Improve Community Environment', 'Promote Environmental Justice', 'Foster Workforce Development', 'Enhance Green Sector Skills']"
Trinity Lutheran Church,2.0,We will be planting two trees: one Northern Red Oak and one Tulip. These trees will be planted in Anderson Park and will be revitalizing the park's tree canopy after the loss of two ash trees that died and had to be removed in recent years. ,"Goal 1: Plant and provide ongoing care for one Northern Red Oak tree and one Tulip tree in Anderson Park.
 * The emerald ash borer has been an increasingly problematic invasive insect species for Illinois ash trees, which accounted for approximately 20% of the urban tree canopy in the state according to a 2022 report from the University of Illinois Extension. After the loss of two ash trees in Anderson Park, there is currently less shade available for visitors. Our project will benefit people using the park by offering them some additional shade and escape from the sun on the hot days that are likely to become more numerous due to climate change, and the tree species we will plant are not susceptible to the invasive insect.
 * The new trees will offer diverse new habitats for wildlife in the Anderson Park area. 
 * The area around Anderson Park has fewer trees than many areas of Canton, so these new trees and the shade they provide may encourage more local residents to visit the park.Measurement of Goal: We will be able to document when the trees are planted, and will be able to document the ongoing care activities.Timing of Goal: The planting portion of this goal will be accomplished in the spring of 2025. The ongoing care portion of the goal has no end date but is rather the persistent work of the Canton Park District; however, for the purposes of this grant proposal, their work will continue according to the standards for no less than three years.
Goal 2: Engage various youth groups in education and hands-on work related to tree care.
 * Local youth will benefit from this project's exposing them to forestry and park management as possible career paths. 
 * Involvement with a park tree project will also afford youth groups ready opportunities to discuss environmental stewardship. This is especially important for church youth groups, as the intersection of faith and the environment often tends to be sidelined in youth group planning due to other topics getting more media attention and thus generating more public discourse.
 * The youth involvement with our project will help bring additional visitors and attention to Anderson Park, which is located in the center of a relatively high-poverty residential neighborhood. Helpers who spend time at the park for this project may develop relationships with local residents they encounter over repeated visits, and they may become aware of other opportunities to support the nearby community. Awareness of community service opportunities is of particular interest for the Trinity Lutheran Church members who are involved with this project, as we are always on the lookout for new ways that we can serve our neighbors.Measurement of Goal: We will track the number of organizations who become involved with the project and the number of youth who participate, as well as survey youth participants and part-time seasonal Park District staff about their interest level in forestry or park management careers.Timing of Goal: Initial youth involvement will take place over the spring and summer of 2025, after which we will establish a regular schedule of youth/organization involvement for the three years of the grant program.",660 E Walnut St,,Canton,Illinois,61520,301 E Chestnut St, ,Canton,IL,61520,"The workforce development component of our project lies in the training of summer seasonal employees and engagement with youth groups. The Canton Park District has ongoing connections that will be leveraged in this project. First, they are working with local 4-H groups to plant a oak savanna habitat in the spring of 2025, and their knowledge will be helpful with this project's Northern Red Oak tree. The district also hosts a Junior Master Naturalists group that can assist in our project. We will also reach out to youth in local scout groups and church youth groups at Trinity and other local congregations. It is our hope that exposing our community's youth to forestry and park management work will help them see those fields as possible career paths. We will also encourage the youth helpers by informing them that those career paths are possible right where they already live, as the Canton Park District receives supportive funding through a local trust fund and is able to employ more people for tree and grounds care than would typically be expected in a town of our size.","The trees will be planted and maintained by the Canton Park District according to the practices and standards they use for all facilities in the district. Their full-time maintenance crew will be responsible for planting, mulching, and watering the trees, as well as using root stimulator to facilitate the trees' long-term health. The full-time staff will also train seasonal (May-August) part-time workers to care for the trees and water them over the summer. The Canton Park District already plants around 20 new trees each year to replace those that have died, provide shade for neighborhood parks, and establish habitat for wildlife, so this Anderson Park project will be conducted under the guidance of an experienced and conscientious public organization and forestry staff. This grant proposal also includes funding for worker training to ensure that the part-time staff are well-equipped to care for the trees.

St Luke MB Church,15.0,"St. Luke's Green Team, in partnership with local environmental organizations and community stakeholders, proposes a transformative urban green sanctuary in Chicago's South Shore neighborhood. Our vision is to create a beautiful garden lab that serves as a peaceful, green sanctuary for meditation and reflection, a place where we can honor our ancestors and loved ones, and a place to implement urban forestry, and landscaping for workforce development.  

Planting 15 trees is a strategic initiative with several important goals. We aim to create a peaceful, green space for reflection and remembrance, while also providing significant environmental benefits like cleaner air and cooler temperatures. This project will also offer workforce training opportunities, empowering community members with valuable skills for green jobs. We are committed to promoting tree equity in the South Shore community, ensuring that all residents can enjoy the benefits of a healthy urban forest. 
To ensure the project's success and sustainability, we will implement a comprehensive approach that includes:

Workforce Development: We will collaborate with local experts to conduct workshops on tree planting, care, maintenance, landscaping and entrepreneurialism. These workshops will empower participants with the knowledge and skills needed to actively participate in the project and have skills and confidence to go beyond this project.

Data Tracking: We believe this grant creates an opportunity to track the role urban forestry plays in our communities. Starting with our lot we’ll track tree species, growth and leverage tools to determine tree equity on a spatial level.  Then share the data with the larger community.

Ongoing Maintenance and Monitoring: A dedicated team of volunteers, trained through our workshops, will ensure the trees receive proper care and maintenance. We will engage a certified arborist to assist in monitoring and tracking the health and growth of the trees, allowing us to make any necessary adjustments.
Community Engagement and Outreach: We will actively involve the community throughout the project, from planning and design to implementation and maintenance. This will include organizing volunteer events, educational programs, and community gatherings in the green space.

This currently underutilized space will be revitalized into a green sanctuary for the community. The 15 trees will be strategically planted throughout the perimeter of the lot, providing shade, improving air quality, and enhancing the overall aesthetics. The urban sanctuary design will incorporate existing elements like the raised bed vegetable garden, creating a cohesive and inviting space for community members to gather, reflect, learn and connect with nature. In addition, it will act as our “green lab” for implementing learnings from our workforce development workshops. 

The benefits of this project are multifaceted and far-reaching. Often tree equity and environmental justice can be overlooked in communities covered within the CEJST map. Implementing a project like this helps, church and community to actualize the concept of equity spatially through the prism of nature. CEJST neighborhoods require places of refuge within nature. Accessible green space for recreation, relaxation, and outdoor activities can be therapeutic. Understanding nature through discourse of faith and civic stewardship helps to re envision what our future can look like. 

These benefits are particularly important in South Shore, a community that has historically faced environmental injustices and limited access to green space. Studies have shown that by increasing tree canopy cover, we can have a tangible impact towards environmental equity and improving the overall health and well-being of residents. 

Moreover, this project will be a source for showcasing the transformative power of faith, collaboration, and collective action. By actively involving residents in the design, implementation, and maintenance of the garden park, we are fostering a sense of ownership and agency. Additionally, by providing workforce training opportunities for individuals facing barriers to entry, equipping them with valuable skills and empowering them to participate in the green economy. This project goes beyond planting trees; it's about cultivating a sense of community, empowerment, and opportunity in the South Shore neighborhood.

In doing so, it will have lasting social, environmental, and economic impacts, particularly for the underserved women and children we serve.

At the core of this initiative are the women and children residing at Casa, many of whom have survived trauma and abuse. The residents will experience healing and empowerment through their participation in this initiative, which will provide them with meaningful opportunities to reconnect with themselves, with each other, and with nature. By engaging with nature, planting trees, and participating in healing workshops, survivors of trauma will have an opportunity to experience the calming, restorative benefits of nature. For individuals who have experienced abuse, nature can be a safe, healing space where they can regain a sense of control, hope, and resilience. Through hands-on activities such as gardening, tree planting, and urban greening, participants will build skills that not only nurture the environment but also nurture their own mental health. Beyond the residents at Casa Esperanza, the broader community will benefit from this initiative as well. The beautification of a property located in a disadvantaged community will create an environment that is not only more inviting, but inspiring— inspiring connection, inspiring community, inspiring growth, and inspiring solidarity. One of the overarching goals of this initiative is to provide sustainable employment opportunities for those in need. Through the development of skills in urban forestry, gardening, and landscaping, workforce development participants will be provided with the skills needed to create tangible career paths in a multitude of industries from urban planning to environmental conservation, ultimately increasing their employability and financial independence.

Within this initiative is the embedded pillar of environmental justice. Our community, similar to many other underserved and underprivileged communities, has long faced limited access to green spaces, exposure to pollutants, and a lack of environmental resources— environmental injustice and inequality. Through the integration of urban forestry into the property of Casa, this initiative will remedy some of the disparities seen within our community and ultimately add to the environmental equity of the community we call home. 

Aside from nature, workforce development is an integral part of Casa’s core. With the addition of providing training in skills related to urban forestry and landscaping, Casa is not only addressing environmental concerns but also creating pathways to stable employment to those who may have faced barriers to employment in the past. Through our partnership with CAPs, this initiative will provide employment to those with “blemished backgrounds,” who may not have found employment opportunities otherwise. By offering workforce development opportunities, this initiative will not remain surface level but will aid in breaking the cycle of poverty within the families and communities of participants. Through employment, participation in this initiative will provide a sense of confidence to overcome future obstacles and an overall sense of resilience. 

While the immediate impacts of this project are significant, the long-term potential is even greater. We envision a community that is not only healed and resilient but also thriving in terms of both environmental sustainability and economic stability. Through this initiative, we hope to see an occurring chain reaction of growth within our community. Through the green spaces provided here at Casa and the transferable skills provided through the project, the green spaces are not limited and instead are encouraged to expand.",8801 S Saginaw Avenue, ,Chicago,IL,60617,8801 S Saginaw Avenue, ,Chicago,IL,60617,"Casa Esperanza Project plans to support urban and community forestry workforce development by creating employment opportunities through a partnership with CAPs (Community Assistance Programs), a workforce development program.  We plan to utilize 6-8 individuals, specifically having ""disadvantaged backgrounds"" in efforts to offer them an opportunity to obtain new skills potentially leading to enhanced employment opportunities.  Further, we hope to hire individuals within the South Chicago community as a means to hire from within the community we serve.

Our partners from Openlands will provide educational sessions to teach about different types of trees and the purpose they serve to benefit the environment.  Additionally, Openlands offers a Treekeepers Certification.  Through the TreeKeeper Certification Course, tree lovers of all ages and backgrounds gain accessible training and education that certify them as an official TreeKeeper. The month-long course gives participants an appreciation for trees in our region through learning about urban forestry in the age of climate change and best practices in tree planting and care to build a more resilient urban forest. 
After completing the program, they are certified to care for, protect, and plant trees with Openlands. Through the TreeKeepers Program, TreeKeepers can volunteer for and lead tree planting events, participate in or organize their own pruning days, take part in continuing education and advocacy programs, and join or start their own TreeKeeper Chapter to advance community-based forestry goals. Many become leaders in their neighborhood advocating for trees and the environment and supporting other community-driven regional efforts. No matter your engagement level, TreeKeeper stewardship is a flexible and accessible way to give back to nature and your community and to make our region more resilient in the face of climate change.

Individuals seeking an opportunity to be considered for employment must first complete the Treekeepers certification and should also attend a set number of the healing workshops offered through this venture.","Casa Esperanza Project is committed to succeeding in its Urban and Community forestry initiative, ensuring the survival and health of each planted Thuja occidentalis through careful planning and oversight. We have partnered with Openlands, who will oversee the entire tree care component of the initiative. They will provide TreeKeeper certifications to minimally eight individuals who will be responsible for planting and maintaining the trees during the first three years of the initiative. 

The Thuja occidentalis (Northern White Cedar) trees will be planted in early spring, following the last frost, or in late fall before the ground freezes. For this initial planting phase, we plan to focus on shorter hedge varieties, which will require spacing of 3 to 4 feet apart. Larger trees, when planted, would require 5 to 6 feet of spacing. Each tree will be surrounded by 1 to 3 inches of mulch, with the mulch kept 3 to 4 inches away from the tree's trunk to prevent rot and encourage healthy growth. 

Newly planted Thuja occidentalis require daily watering for the first 2 to 3 months. To ensure and encourage a healthy foundation, we will provide at least one gallon of water per tree each day, potentially increasing watering frequency to twice daily during hotter periods. 

The labor force sourced from CAPs will be responsible for daily care and maintenance of the trees. However, Openlands will manage the certification and training of TreeKeepers, covering essential tasks such as planting, mulching, watering, and general upkeep. 

Following the conclusion of the grant period, Casa Esperanza Project plans to contract with a professional landscaping company to continue maintaining the health of the trees, ensuring their growth and sustainability for years to come.

Grace Congregational United Church of Christ,20.0,"The project addresses the significant loss of urban canopy caused by EAB infestations and neglect for early tree care which has left many areas of Two Rivers vulnerable to increased heat, reduced shade, and diminished biodiversity. Planting 20 native trees in Washington Park will mitigate urban heat, reduce storm water runoff, enhance aesthetics, and improve air quality.
A key focus is workforce development through the hiring of a forestry-focused Youth Apprentice. The apprentice will gain hands-on experience in planting, pruning, and tree care, building skills for a future career in arboriculture. By working with Parks and Recreation staff, the apprentice will play an essential role in maintaining the newly planted trees and supporting the City’s expanding urban forestry efforts. 
The project also aims to build a community of trained volunteers to address a critical gap in young tree pruning. Proper pruning during the first few years of a tree’s life is vital for its safety and longevity, but the city struggles to complete these prunes due to resource limitations. Volunteers trained in pruning workshops will provide much-needed support, ensuring that young trees receive the care they need.
With a record number of tree plantings planned for 2025, this project is essential for building the capacity to care for an expanding urban canopy. It supports the City’s broader goals of creating greener, healthier, and more sustainable neighborhoods, particularly in underserved areas.","This project will increase urban canopy and reduce stormwater runoff in Two Rivers by planting 20 trees in Washington Park. The park is in a disadvantaged neighborhood. Visitors to the park will benefit from the mental and physical health impacts of the trees and natural surroundings. Volunteers from Grace Congregational Church and the community will plant the park trees during an Arbor Day weekend event. The Parks and Recreation Department will hire a forestry-focused Youth Apprentice to assist with tree planting, watering, and pruning, providing critical workforce development opportunities. The apprentice will work alongside seasonal Parks and Recreation staff to ensure proper tree care throughout the summer. The long-standing apprentice program through CESA 6 has been a major contributor to workforce development in partnership with our local schools. https://www.yawisconsin.org/ Community engagement will be central to this initiative.

This project will support environmental justice in our community by promoting equitable access to green spaces. Historically marginalized communities like North Lawndale often lack adequate tree cover. We have been change that narrative for the past five years and with the project we continue to change the narrative. Planting trees helps address this disparity, ensuring that all residents enjoy the environmental benefits of a robust tree canopy. Two additional benefits are climate resilience and community empowerment. Trees mitigate the impacts of climate change by capturing carbon dioxide, managing storm water and provide a cooling effect. This resilience is especially important in impoverished areas that are disproportionately affected by extreme weather. We will continue to involve local residents in treat panting projects. This fosters environmental awareness and engagement, helping communities take ownership of their green spaces. 

Lastly, our project will support workforce development as we provide training for jobs in he green industry, ongoing stewardship roles, and economic growth.:


        *  Tree planting initiatives create opportunities for training youth an adults in urban forestry, permaculture and environmental stewardship. 
        *  Newly planted trees require maintenance which prompts sustainable job opportunities in landscaping, tree care and environmental    management. 
        * Green initiatives can spur economic growth by attracting investment, increasing property values and supporting local businesses that depend on health ecosystems.

We envision improved learning outcomes for students enrolled at Gerber/Noel Education Center due to improved mental health/emotional well-being, physical activity, and a deeper understanding of the inherent connection with nature. We also envision family and staff will benefit in the same ways.
Cunningham Children’s home is an exemplary, trauma-informed child welfare and educational services agency that provides caring support and therapeutic intervention to more than 977 children, youth, adults, and families each year through comprehensive programs including residential treatment, special education, and community-based services. The K-12 students enrolled at Gerber and Noel have limited exposure to the natural world while research has consistently demonstrated exposure to green space improves cognitive and academic abilities, memory, concentration, emotional well-being,lower cortisol levels, reduced anxiety and overall improvement of mood. Increased physical activity also has been shown to improve academic performance. For example, one study found that students who had access to green views from their classrooms performed better on tests of concentration and cognitive functioning compared to peers in schools with less green space. Additionally, studies have shown that natural environments can help reduce stress levels. Schools with green spaces also encourage outdoor play and physical activity, both of which are linked to improved academic performance.

We envision the beginning of a robust workforce development program in urban forestry and related environmental fields within marginalized communities.
The expertise of the project’s collaborators—in urban forestry as well as overall environmental sciences and related fields—offers strong opportunities for workforce development. Working with DREAAM, young adults from underserved communities will be identified; these paid individuals will work along side urban forestry professionals as they plant and maintain the trees. Printed and online resources will be developed and provided to students to enrich their education. Older students at Gerber and Noel will also have the opportunity to participate in this workforce development and, if interest is sufficient, classes will be created to further their education. With the robust collection of collaborators, students will have ample opportunity not only to work alongside these professionals, but to work with University students and faculty as well as with UI Extension resources. We hope this project will serve as the genesis for a more formal program in urban forestry for individuals in marginalized communities.

We envision a robust and holistic educational program that can serve as a model for education professionals.
Green spaces provide ample opportunities for hands-on learning in a variety of disciplines. Students can observe plants, wildlife, and ecosystems while learning about biodiversity, ecosystems, and conservation. Curriculums can be developed across a broad spectrum of subjects, including art, science, math, and more. Students can actively participate in caring for trees, learning responsibility, teamwork, and hands-on skills. Outdoor learning integrates physical, emotional, and intellectual development, making it a holistic and effective approach to education. The project plans to work with Gerber/Noel faculty as well as retired teachers to develop holistic educational curriculums driven by nature.

We envision an enhanced environmental and aesthetic quality.
Planting trees is a crucial strategy for mitigating climate change as they act as natural carbon sinks and cooling the environment through shade and evapotranspiration, thus counteracting the urban heat island effect in our cities and thereby reducing energy demands. A majority of trees selected are hardwood trees due to their ability to support rich biodiversity. Climate resiliency will be strengthened with improved air quality, decreased flood risks from stormwater runoff, less soil erosion, and cooler microclimates. Adn finally, an expanse of trees is aesthetically superior to no green spaces.

We envision a neighborhood gathering space for improved community engagement.
Students, families, and staff can engage the broader community in beautifying their neighborhood, instilling a sense of pride and ownership. Trees create shaded areas where families and community members can gather, strengthening community bonds.",Garden Hills Elementary School ,,Champaign,Illinois,61821,114County Road 1900 North, ,Seymour,IL,61875,"Creating a workforce development component for urban forestry is a key component of the project. The expertise of the project’s partners in urban forestry is considerable, and it is our belief that we can shape a program that will grow in size over time, especially with the expertise of DREAAM in supporting young black men as they reach adulthood. For example, DREAAM and 4 Osprey recently launched a culinary school for young adults which pays students to attend the school and, as part of their training, create meals for underserved communities. The program hopes to open a once-a-week cafe during its second year of operation. The formation of the culinary school has been invaluable to 4 Osprey’s future endeavors, and developing a robust urban forestry program for underserved communities is in reach. The project’s partners—UPD, CPD, CCFPD, and UI—are uniquely positioned to not only provide expertise, but to potentially provide an infrastructure for a training program in urban forestry.

Just Roots,15.0,"The project will be led by Just Roots and Grace United Church of Christ, with support from community volunteers. Our team has years of experience planting and caring for trees and we feel highly confident in our ability to successfully lead this project.

This project will enable us to expand our orchard at It Takes A Village Community Farm by planting 15 additional fruit trees. This includes five paw paw trees (Asimina Triloba), five service berry (Amenlanchier) trees, three pear (Pyrus Communis) trees, and two apple (Malus Domestica) trees. The trees will be planted on the south end of our farm in the Fall of 2025 and will be cared for using organic and regenerative practices. The trees will help to enhance our community green space and support the therapeutic and educational programming we facilitate at the farm on a weekly basis. Additionally, once the trees begin bearing fruit, we will harvest and distribute that food to community members within a five mile radius through various healthy food access initiatives. All of the fruit we harvest will be distributed within 24 hours, ensuring that it’s as fresh and nutritionally dense as possible. 

We will also plant five Eastern Redbud (Cercis Canadensis) trees on the perimeter of our orchard. These trees will serve as windbreaks, which will help us to better protect our crops, increase water retention, minimize soil erosion, and foster a more biodiverse green space. ","Many communities in Cook County lack access to community green spaces where they can access fresh food that’s healthy, affordable, and culturally relevant. This often leaves people to choose between healthy food options and other daily necessities. According to the Chicago Food Equity Council, 19% of people experience food insecurity in the Chicago region and that increases to 29% in LatinX communities and 37% in Black communities. Furthermore, according to the Illinois Department of Public Health, one in five people in the state of Illinois dies from a diet and nutrition related health condition. Illinois is one of the largest agricultural producers in the country, and yet over 90% of the food grown in the state travels outside of it. 

Conversely, less than one hundred years ago, the Chicago region was teeming with community food growing spaces. The first nations to grow food in the region were members of the Council of The Three Fires, made up of the Odaawaa, Ojibwa, and Potawatomi, as well as the Illini and Miami Peoples. Later on, Chicago became a leader during the Victory Garden Era, with roughly 1,500 community gardens and 250,000 home gardens producing up to 40% of the City’s food supply. 

Inspired by that history, our project is based in Sauk Village, a predominantly Black community located in southern Cook County. According to Advocate South Suburban Hospital’s Community Health Needs Assessment Report, Sauk Village has a hardship index of 76.5, which is 25 points above the average score for Cook County and the fifth highest score among south suburban communities. According to the report, “greater hardship values correlate higher with poor health outcomes.” 

Through our work at It Takes A Village Community Farm, we are working to address these social, economic, and health challenges by cultivating a welcoming and inclusive community green space where we grow fresh, healthy, culturally relevant food, facilitate free educational programs, and host community events. Currently, It Takes A Village is operating on 1.5 acres of land, with the capacity to expand to 3 acres in the coming years. Within our existing operation, we grow and distribute over 20,000 pounds of fresh food and host over 1,000 people at the farm each year through our various education and community building initiatives. Once the farm is fully built out and operational, we anticipate being able to produce over 50,000 pounds of food annually. 

This project directly supports that vision by providing our team with the resources to expand our existing orchard and produce more food for the community. By planting 15 new fruit trees, we anticipate being able to produce an additional 750 pounds of food on an annual basis. In addition to producing more fresh food, the trees will support our efforts to provide accessible green space that supports the health and well being of the community. Like everything on our farm, the trees will be planted and cared for using organic and regenerative practices, helping us to demonstrate a model of farming that is good for both people and the planet. For example, we will be planting 5 trees as windbreaks, which will help us to minimize soil erosion, retain water, reduce flooding, protect our crops from wind damage, and help create cleaner air. 

The food we produce from these trees will either be provided directly to residents or distributed through our partnerships with schools, health clinics, food pantries, and mutual aid organizations. For example, we partner with School District 168 to provide school cafeterias with fresh food from our farm, and we pair that food with cooking demonstrations, nutrition workshops, farm scavenger hunts, and other health and wellness programs. 

This project will also benefit our Growing Young Leaders program, which provides green jobs training and leadership development for youth between the ages of 16-24. In addition to developing skills, in regenerative urban agriculture, participants receive training in financial literacy, cooking and nutrition, job readiness, and leadership. While building professional skills, program participants have the opportunity to contribute to the social and economic development of their community by growing fresh, healthy food, facilitating educational programs, and hosting community events. This project will allow members of our Growing Young Leaders program to plant and care for trees and learn new agricultural skills in the process. 

As an organization, we believe it’s our responsibility to not just grow food for others, but also equip people with the skills and tools they need to grow their own food and integrate practices that support improved health and wellness. Our ultimate goal is that, one day, every resident will be able to equitably access local, healthy, culturally relevant food, regardless of their zip code. This project supports our efforts to not only have a significant impact in the communities we serve, but also offer a model for other communities working to establish community green spaces that contribute to the development of a regenerative and community driven food system. ",PO Box 16444, ,Chicago,IL,60616,PO Box 16444, ,Chicago,IL,60616,"This project will support workforce development in urban and community forestry through two different initiatives that we lead. First, this project will support our Growing Young Leaders program, which provides green jobs training and leadership development to south suburban youth between the ages of 16-24. The program helps participants to become more knowledgeable, hardworking, and well-rounded leaders in their community, while also developing skills in regenerative agriculture, cooking and nutrition, financial literacy, and job readiness. Overall, the program is designed to help youth participants build skills, see themselves as leaders, and recognize the importance of doing work that benefits their community. Our team recently evaluated our 2024 program and, through that evaluation process, we learned that participants are seeking more diversified tasks on the farm. Next year, we are already planning to expand the diversity of agricultural and food related skills that participants learn throughout the course of the program. This tree planting project will directly support that goal. 

Secondly, this project will enhance our ability to provide technical support services to neighboring farms and gardens. Currently, in addition to leading our own two farms, we provide technical support services to six neighboring organizations within a 5 mile radius of our farms, including Ada S. McKinley Community Services, Bronzeville Neighborhood Farm, Eden Place Farms, Pacific Garden Mission, Aquinas Literacy Center, and Mother Carr’s Farm. Through our three years leading this technical support program, we have designed and built two new farms, supported the revitalization of two existing farms, created new job opportunities, and significantly increased access to local, healthy, culturally relevant food in Cook County. Recently, several farms that we support have asked for guidance with planting and caring for fruit trees. This project will enhance our ability to support those organizations and further contribute to the development of our local food system. ","All 20 trees will be planted on the south end of our farm, with 15 foot spacing between trees. We will dig holes that are 18-24 inches wide and a minimum of 18 inches deep. Because of our experience planting trees in the same area on our farm, we already know that the soil is easy to dig out and has good drainage. We will dig the holes 24-72 hours before planting, depending on the forecast for that week. When planting the trees, we will mix in some organic compost with the native soil to add nutrients and improve the soil structure. We will also add a top layer of mulch to support drainage, water retention, nutrient enrichment, and weed suppression. To ensure that the trees are planted properly, Just Roots team members will work with volunteers to supervise and support the planting of every tree. Additionally, our existing walkways between the rows of trees will be upgraded and expanded to ensure that staff, volunteers, and community members can easily and consistently access the orchard for a variety of health and wellness activities.  

We have a newly installed well and an existing irrigation system on site. However, once the new trees are planted, we will need to expand our irrigation system in order to consistently water the new trees on a weekly basis. Depending on the amount of rainfall, we will likely utilize that irrigation system 1-2 times/week. Furthermore, we have some deer fencing already installed around the perimeter of the farm, but we are requesting funding to expand and reinforce that fencing to ensure that the deer do not damage our trees.

On a weekly basis, our team conducts a farm walk. During these walks, our farm operations team will evaluate the health of the trees and make necessary adjustments to the maintenance plan based on the needs of the plants. Ongoing maintenance tasks will include watering, weeding around the trees, and utilizing organic and regenerative integrated pest management (IPM) strategies when needed. On an annual basis, trees will be pruned in the Spring and potentially one additional time in the Fall. All of this work will be led by our Farm Manager, Paul Krysik, who has 10 years of experience leading urban green spaces and caring for trees of all varieties. It will be supported by our Farm Operations Manager, Farm Associate, and members of our Growing Young Leaders program. 

Once the trees are planted, they will be immediately integrated into all of our existing educational programs and services. This includes our fall Horticulture workshop series, which takes place in October, our Growing Young Leaders program, Farm to School programming, Fresh Food Farmacy, and weekly visits from youth and adult volunteer groups. We will also utilize our social media channels, newsletter, and other digital communication channels to share information about the project and provide educational tools and resources for the community. This work aligns with our broader organizational goal of developing a thriving community that learns and shares about local, healthy, regenerative food practices together.

Youth Conservation Corps,20.0,"Youth Conservation Corps (YCC) is implementing an Urban and Community Forestry project to expand green spaces, improve environmental health, and provide workforce training for young adults. The project will involve planting 20 non-invasive native trees, including Bur Oak, Swamp White Oak, Chinkapin Oak, Butternut Hickory, American Linden, White Pine, and Kentucky Coffee trees, across two key locations in Waukegan: Washington Park and Larsen Park. These species were selected for their adaptability to the regional climate, resilience, and ability to provide long-term ecological benefits, such as air purification, heat island reduction, and habitat support.

The planting will take place over four days in late May. Each tree will be carefully spaced, planted with roots at the proper depth, and supported by thorough watering (10–15 gallons per tree) and mulching (2–4 inches around the base). Protective guards and stakes will be installed to shield the trees from animals and harsh weather.

The project is designed to address environmental justice by improving green space access and air quality in underserved communities while simultaneously empowering local youth. Program participants will gain valuable experience in tree planting, maintenance, and conservation practices, supported by certifications such as OSHA and Environmental Literacy through the Roots of Success program.

To ensure the long-term success of the trees, YCC has developed a robust four-year maintenance plan, including regular watering, mulching, and pest management. This initiative will enhance Waukegan’s urban landscape, promote environmental stewardship, and provide meaningful workforce development opportunities.","This project targets environmental injustices in under-resourced communities within Lake County, Illinois, where the impacts of historical industrial pollution have led to ongoing environmental and health challenges. Areas such as Waukegan and North Chicago, where YCC is deeply embedded, face some of the region's most significant environmental burdens. These communities, primarily composed of low-income Black and Latine residents, are disproportionately affected by pollution from former industrial sites, including Superfund locations and coal ash ponds. Consequently, residents experience high rates of respiratory issues, such as asthma and COPD, along with other health concerns linked to poor air and soil quality. 

Through increased tree canopy and accessible green spaces, this project seeks to mitigate these adverse conditions by improving air quality, reducing urban heat islands, and creating spaces for recreation and respite. Trees play a critical role in absorbing pollutants and cooling local areas, making neighborhoods healthier and more livable. In Lake County, studies show that green spaces are often lacking in low-income neighborhoods compared to wealthier ones, impacting quality of life, access to nature, and overall community well-being. 

This project also serves as a platform for youth empowerment, providing local young adults with hands-on training in urban forestry and conservation through YCC’s Urban and Community Forestry program. Participants will gain skills in tree planting, environmental stewardship, and long-term forestry management, creating pathways into green careers that not only benefit the environment but also offer economic mobility. 

By involving youth from the community, YCC promotes a cycle of local environmental stewardship, workforce development, and empowerment. Focused on environmental justice, YCC’s program restores essential green spaces in these historically underserved areas and aims to strengthen the connection between community health and environmental resilience. As a result, the project will contribute to a legacy of sustainable careers and community-led improvements in environmental quality, establishing healthier outdoor spaces while addressing long-standing inequities in green space access and air quality. ",Robert McClory Bike Path,,"Waukegan, IL",Illinois,60087,1020 W. Greenwood Avenue, ,Waukegan,IL,60087,"Through this project, YCC will establish clear pathways into urban forestry and environmental careers for young adults from under-resourced Lake County communities. Participants will gain hands-on experience in tree planting, maintenance, and environmental management, with skills directly applicable to green industries. Certifications, such as OSHA and Environmental Literacy through Roots of Success, enhance their qualifications for roles in forestry, conservation, and sustainability.

This project tackles employment barriers by providing job readiness training, resume support, and industry-specific skills, preparing participants for sustainable careers in conservation. Partnerships with local agencies, including the Lake County Forest Preserves and Waukegan Park District, offer direct placement opportunities in urban forestry, park maintenance, and conservation. YCC has also developed connections with firms like CF Industries and Gewalt Hamilton, which actively seek employees trained in environmental management.

Beyond initial placements, YCC’s relationship with Lake County Partners provides access to additional green industry employers. By aligning with the region’s growing demand for environmental and sustainability roles, YCC opens new avenues for youth to secure stable, impactful jobs that contribute to community resilience and environmental justice.

YCC’s Urban and Community Forestry program not only introduces participants to conservation fields but also fosters long-term interest in green careers, helping build a local workforce dedicated to sustainable practices. As employers increasingly invest in green infrastructure, YCC’s training and placement initiative empowers young adults to contribute to environmental health and economic growth in their own communities.","Planting Plan
The tree planting will occur over four days in late May, taking advantage of optimal conditions for root establishment. YCC will plant 20 non-invasive, climate-suited native trees, including Bur Oak, Swamp White Oak, Chinkapin Oak, Butternut Hickory, American Linden, White Pine, and Kentucky Coffee trees, across two locations: Washington Park and Larsen Park in Waukegan, IL.

Each planting day will begin with a site assessment to confirm optimal planting locations based on soil quality, sunlight, and drainage. Planting sites will be spaced at least 8 feet apart to allow adequate room for growth. Tree holes will be dug to twice the width of the root ball and backfilled with soil after placement. Each tree will be watered thoroughly (10–15 gallons per tree) immediately after planting and mulched with a 2–4 inch layer to retain soil moisture and regulate temperature. Protective guards or stakes will be installed around each tree to shield them from weather, animals, and human activity.

Watering Plan
During the first three years, each tree will receive 10 gallons of water weekly during the growing season (spring through fall). YCC will utilize drip irrigation bags to ensure slow, deep watering for optimal root hydration. A water truck trailer will be available to transport water to the sites as needed, ensuring consistent access even during dry spells. In subsequent years, watering will transition to an as-needed basis, primarily during drought conditions, as the trees become more drought-tolerant.

Mulching and Maintenance
Mulch will be replenished annually to maintain a 2–4 inch layer around each tree, taking care to keep it from touching the trunk. Mulching will help conserve moisture, suppress weeds, and improve soil health. Weeds will be removed regularly to minimize competition for resources, especially during the first three years.

Education for Maintenance
YCC staff and program participants will receive education and training on tree care as part of the Urban and Community Forestry program. This includes instruction on proper planting techniques, mulching, watering schedules, pest monitoring, and pruning best practices. The training will be informed by the US Forest Service’s Tree Owner Manual and conducted by YCC’s Urban and Community Forestry Supervisor, Ron Rightreiser, who brings extensive experience in conservation and tree care.

Maintenance Plan for 3 Years Post-Planting

Year 1 (Establishment Phase): Focus on developing strong root systems. Weekly watering will be prioritized, along with regular mulching and weed control. Minimal pruning will be performed to remove damaged or dead branches. Trees will be monitored closely to ensure they adapt well to their environment.

Year 2 (Growth Phase): Continue weekly watering, mulching, and weed control. Structural pruning will begin to shape healthy growth. Trees will be inspected for pests or diseases, and targeted treatments will be applied if necessary.

Year 3 (Canopy Development Phase): Watering frequency will be adjusted based on weather conditions, with a focus on building drought tolerance. Mulching, weed control, and pest monitoring will continue, along with pruning to promote vertical growth and canopy development.

Year 4 (Maturity and Ongoing Maintenance): Trees should be drought-tolerant; water only during prolonged dry spells. Maintain mulch, control weeds, and monitor for pests. Prune deadwood in fall and reinforce protective measures for winter.

Long-Term Maintenance and Responsibility
Beyond the first three years, the trees will require minimal maintenance. YCC staff will monitor the trees’ health and conduct watering during prolonged dry spells. Mulch will be maintained, and periodic pruning will ensure healthy growth. Protective measures such as tree guards will be reinforced as needed, especially during the winter months.

The Urban and Community Forestry team, led by Ron Rightreiser, will oversee all maintenance activities. Program participants will also assist, gaining hands-on experience in tree care while supporting the project’s long-term success. This model not only ensures tree survival but also educates the next generation of environmental stewards, fostering a legacy of conservation and care.

This comprehensive approach to planting, watering, mulching, and maintenance ensures that the trees thrive in the long term, contributing to the ecological and aesthetic health of Waukegan’s urban landscape.","['Swamp White Oak', 'Pine', 'Butternut', 'Oak', 'White Oak', 'Bur Oak', 'Coffee']","{'Bur Oak': 3, 'Swamp White Oak': 3, 'Chinkapin Oak': 3, 'Butternut Hickory': 3, 'American Linden': 3, 'White Pine': 3, 'Kentucky Coffee tree': 3}","['Improve air quality through increased tree canopy and accessible green spaces', 'Reduce urban heat islands by increasing tree coverage', 'Create recreational and respite spaces for community members', 'Mitigate health issues caused by pollution through improved environment quality', 'Provide local youth with hands-on training in urban forestry and conservation', 'Develop skills in tree planting, environmental stewardship, and long-term forestry management', 'Create pathways into green careers offering economic mobility', 'Promote local environmental stewardship, workforce development, and empowerment', 'Strengthen the connection between community health and environmental resilience', 'Contribute to a legacy of sustainable careers and community-led improvements in environmental quality', 'Address long-standing inequities in green space access and air quality']"
Reformation Lutheran Church,15.0,"Reformation Lutheran Church will plant up to 15 trees within Washington Park in the city of Milwaukee and maintain the trees over a 4-year period. The trees will be placed on park land that is maintained by the Urban Ecology Center, a 501(c)3 organization dedicated to ecology education and public programs. UEC Land Management staff will select tree species based on the list of recommended trees provided by Faith in Place and the approved UEC restoration and management plan.

This project will be a partnership of efforts by Reformation Lutheran Church and the Urban Ecology Center. The roles of the three parties are as follows:  Reformation Lutheran Church will receive and administer grant funds, provide progress reports to FIP, manage the schedule for tree planting and maintenance, and coordinate Program volunteers (adults and youth) for tree planting and maintenance. The UEC will purchase and plant trees to Parks Department specifications, provide water and education for Program volunteers (adults and youth), specify tree species and maintenance requirements in accordance with the County’s long term tree restoration, and manage the schedule for tree planting and maintenance.","The goals of our project are three-fold:Help to restore the urban tree canopy over approximately 2-acres Washington Park in the County of Milwaukee.Provide education in tree planting and maintenance, and part-time work on tree maintenance to adult and youth community members and members of Reformation Church Lutheran Church over a 4-year period.Apply the long-standing partnership between Reformation Church and the Urban Ecology Center to perform the work efficiently and effectively to accomplish the goals of this grant program.",Washington Park: 4023 W Galena St,,Milwaukee,Wisconsin,53208,3806 W.

The project will provide hands-on training in urban forestry, environmental stewardship, and sustainable land management, creating pathways for future employment in green industries.

Workforce Development Goals include: develop skills in urban forestry:, provide job-readiness training, support long-term employment opportunities, and create pathways for career advancement: 

Develop Skills in Urban Forestry: Equip participants with the knowledge and practical skills for careers in urban forestry, horticulture, and environmental conservation.

Provide Job-Readiness Training: Through hands-on experience in tree planting and maintenance, participants will gain work-ready skills such as teamwork, problem-solving, and communication.

Support Long-Term Employment Opportunities: Build connections between participants and potential employers in urban forestry and environmental sectors.

Create Pathways for Career Advancement: Expose youth and adults to local green industry professionals and career opportunities in tree care, environmental science, and urban development.
Workforce Development Approach:

The approach will be organized into four phases: Training and Education, Hands-On Experience, Mentorship and Career Pathways, and Evaluation and Continuation.

Training and Education (Year 1, Ongoing): Reformation’s congregation and community members, particularly youth, will engage in UEC’s programs like Restoring Our Outdoors Together (ROOT) and botany walks. Participants will learn land restoration, ecosystem rehabilitation, and the role of native plants in supporting wildlife. UEC will conduct training on tree planting, tree care, urban ecology, and safety protocols, preparing participants for both fieldwork and future employment.

Hands-On Experience (Years 1-4): Practical experience is essential. Volunteers will gain direct experience in urban forestry tasks, including planting trees, watering, mulching, pruning, pest management, and tree assessments. Over time, participants will assume increasing responsibilities, such as coordinating projects, managing volunteer teams, and leading small planting events, helping them develop leadership and organizational skills.

Mentorship and Career Pathways (Years 3-4): Mentorship is key to workforce development. UEC and Reformation will connect participants with mentors in urban forestry, offering workshops on job readiness, resume writing, interview skills, communication, time management, and problem-solving. These sessions will prepare participants for the workforce by developing both technical and soft skills.

Evaluation and Continuation (Ongoing, Annual): The program will include regular evaluations to track participant progress, assess the impact of training, and identify areas for improvement. These evaluations will track employment outcomes such as internships, job placements, or further education. The program will adapt based on feedback to ensure continued success.

By integrating training, hands-on experience, mentorship, and job readiness into the project, the ministry provides a unique opportunity for community members to develop skills for careers in urban forestry and environmental sustainability. This initiative will lay the foundation for a stronger, more sustainable green workforce in Milwaukee.","To ensure the long-term survival and health of the trees, we will implement a comprehensive maintenance plan following the guidelines of the UEC and Milwaukee County Parks.
