    ## Our Mission: Growing a Just and Sustainable Future

    The **Faith in Place Tree Equity and Forestry Workforce Initiative** is a direct response to environmental injustice in historically underserved communities across Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin. For too long, these communities have faced inequities like lower tree canopy cover, higher pollution, and reduced access to green spaces, leading to adverse health, social, and economic outcomes.

    In partnership with the USDA Forest Service, Faith in Place is empowering local leaders by distributing 65 to 85 grants to community organizations and Houses of Worship. This initiative is about more than just planting trees; it's a four-year commitment to fostering workforce development, stimulating local economies, and empowering communities to become active stewards of their environment.

    ## The Power of Data: Making Our Impact Visible

    This dashboard was created to provide a transparent, data-driven view of the projectâ€™s profound ecological and social benefits. Our goal is to transform complex data into a compelling narrative that educates, inspires, and demonstrates tangible results.

    By tracking key metrics from the very beginning of the grant cycle, we aim to:
    * **Visualize** the geographic scope and diversity of tree planting efforts.
    * **Measure** the initiative's contribution to climate resilience, community well-being, and economic growth.
    * **Ensure** that the benefits of this work are visible, measurable, and accessible to all stakeholders, from community members to funders.

    This tool serves as a living foundation for understanding and amplifying the impact of the USDA Forest Service Tree Grant, telling the story of environmental justice and community resilience in a way that resonates with everyone.
